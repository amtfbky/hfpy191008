# Learn Python the hard way

How long does this course take?

You should take as long as it takes to get through it, but focus on doing work every day. Some people take about 3 months, others 6 months, and some only a week.  I can do it in about 4 hours or less if I hurry and don't do the Study Drills.

这门课要多长时间？
你应该花尽可能长的时间来度过难关，但要专注于每天的工作有些人大约需要3个月，有些人需要6个月，有些人只需要一周。如果我快点不做学习练习，我可以在4小时或更短的时间内完成。

What kind of computer do I need?

You can do it on most any computer.  It works on Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux with instructions for all three in the first exercise.

我需要什么样的电脑？
你可以在任何电脑上做它可以在windows、mac osx和linux上运行，并在第一个练习中为这三个操作提供指导。

## Preface

This simple book is meant to get you started in programming.   The title says it's the hard way to learn to write code but it's  actually not.  It's only the "hard" way because it uses a technique  called *instruction*.  Instruction is where I tell you to do a  sequence of controlled exercises designed to build a skill through  repetition.  This technique works very well with beginners who know  nothing and need to acquire basic skills before they can understand more  complex topics. It's used in everything from martial arts to music to  even basic math and reading skills.

This book instructs you in Python by slowly building and  establishing skills through techniques like practice and memorization,  then applying them to increasingly difficult problems.  By the end of  the book you will have the tools needed to begin learning more complex  programming topics.  I like to tell people that my book gives you your  "programming black belt."  What this means is that you know the basics  well enough to now start learning programming.

If you work hard, take your time, and build these skills, you will learn to code.

# Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Angela for helping me with the first  two versions of this book.  Without her I probably wouldn't have  bothered to finish it at all.  She did the copy-editing of the first  draft and supported me immensely while I wrote it.

I'd also like to thank Greg Newman for doing the original  cover art, Brian Shumate for early website designs, and all of the  people who read this book and took the time to send me feedback and  corrections.

Thank you.

这本简单的书是为了让你开始编程。书名说这是学习写代码的困难方法，但事实并非如此。这只是一种“难”的方法，因为它使用了一种叫做指令的技术。教学是我告诉你做一系列的控制练习，旨在通过重复建立技能。这项技术对初学者非常有效，他们什么都不知道，需要先掌握基本技能，然后才能理解更复杂的主题。从武术到音乐，甚至是基本的数学和阅读技巧，它都被用到了。
这本书用python指导你，通过练习和记忆等技巧慢慢地建立和建立技能，然后将它们应用到越来越困难的问题上。在这本书的最后，你将拥有开始学习更复杂的编程主题所需的工具。我喜欢告诉人们，我的书给了你“编程黑带”，这意味着你对编程的基本知识了如指掌，现在可以开始学习编程了。
如果你努力工作，花点时间，培养这些技能，你就会学会编码。
致谢
我要感谢安吉拉帮助我完成这本书的前两个版本。如果没有她，我可能根本就懒得完成它。她做了初稿的拷贝编辑，在我写初稿时给予了我极大的支持。
我也要感谢格雷格纽曼做的原始封面艺术，布赖恩舒马特早期的网站设计，以及所有人谁读了这本书，并花时间给我的反馈和更正。
谢谢您。

# The Hard Way Is Easier

With the help of this book, you will do the incredibly simple things that all programmers do to learn a programming language:

1. Go through each exercise.
2. Type in each sample *exactly*.
3. Make it run.

That's it.  This will be *very* difficult at first,  but stick with it.  If you go through this book, and do each exercise  for one or two hours a night, you will have a good foundation for moving  onto another book about Python to continue your studies.  This book  won't turn you into a programmer overnight, but it will get you started  on the path to learning how to code.

This book's job is to teach you the three most essential  skills that a beginning programmer needs to know: reading and writing,  attention to detail, and spotting differences.

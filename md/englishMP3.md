**001.How strong are you?** 

**你有多强大？**

That is a tough question to answer, whether you are a man or a woman. 

不管你是男人还是女人，这都是个很难回答的问题。

But, really, I want to ask… how do you define your strength? 

但是，说实话，我想知道，你是怎么定义力量的呢？

How do you know your limits? How do you know just how much you’ve got? 

你是如何了解自己的局限性？你怎么知道你能做到什么程度？

When push comes to shove, we often discover that we are much stronger than we think.

当压力来临时，我们会发现我们比想象中要更强大。

**What is Strength?**

**什么是力量？**

Strength is not always about pure physical strength. Rather, it is about willpower. Discipline. Drive. It is about the capacity to get things done.

力量并不仅仅指你的肌肉力量，它更多的指的是意志力、训练、动力。是一种能够做好事情的能力。

I know some people who are intellectually strong, but they get very little done in their jobs. And I know others who find work extremely challenging, but are able to move mountains by their sheer drive and hard work.

我知道有一些人虽然很聪明，但是他们在工作中能够做好的事情却很少。而另外一些人虽然知道工作很具有挑战性，但他们仍能通过强大的动力和艰苦的工作来移动大山。

They possess inner strength.

他们具有强大的内心力量。

More interesting, is that these productive hard-workers often don’t even notice the load. Bystanders are not only amazed, but often ask, “How do you do it?” 

更有趣的是，这些非常努力工作的人并没有意识到工作量的巨大。旁观者不仅感到很吃惊，而且还经常问，“你是怎么做到的？”

The answer usually comes back, “I just work harder than the others.” 

经常得到这样的回答，“我只是比别人更努力一些罢了。”

So, why are some people able to do more? What gives them added drive? What gives them extra strength?

所以，为什么有些人就能做到更多？他们的动力是哪里来的呢？是谁给予他们多余的力量？

Could it be, they have simply given themselves permission to do more?

还是，仅仅是他们自己给自己力量来做到更多？

**Self-Imposed Limits** 

**自我强加的局限性**

What I have observed is that most people impose their own limits. They limit their output based on self-framed [constraints](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/constraint) of their capabilities and strengths. Sometimes these boundaries are based on past experiences. Sometimes they are based on perceived capacities. Sometimes these limits are based on nothing. 

据我所观察，很多人都是自己强加给自己的局限性。他们有时候根据能力和力量自我设定了他们的局限，有时候根据过去的经历设定一些边界，还有的根据想象中的能力设定，还有些则毫无任何根据就限定了自己的力量。

I can’t do that. (Why?) 

我做不到。（为什么呢？）

That is too much for me. (How do you know?) 

对我来说太难了。（你怎么知道太难？）

I can’t put in that much effort. (What would happen if you did?) 

我做不到那么努力。（如果你做了会怎么样？）=

I am not smart enough to solve that. (Can you be sure if you haven’t tried?)

我不够聪明，解决不了这件事。（你不尝试怎么能如此确定？）

So, how do we break through these limits? How do we get stronger? 

所以，怎样才能打破这些局限？怎么才能更强大？

**Pushing It…**

**给自己点压力**

Many people are going through the motions, but are nowhere near their limits.

很多人都做出了实际行动，但是从来就没有到达他们的极限。

If you want to be stronger, you have to push your boundaries.

如果你想变得更加强大，你就要打破你的局限。

Pushing it is what it takes to increase your limits. In the gym, bodybuilders discovered this long ago. But, the same principle is true when it comes to inner strength. Discipline and drive. 

给自己施加压力就能提高你的极限。在体育馆，健身者很早之前就体会到了这一点。所以，同样的原则运用到内心力量方面也是正确的，训练自己，给自己一些动力。

Want to test your limits? Push yourself. Test your self-perceived constraints to see how accurate they are. Make sure your goals are slightly beyond what you think can be achieved. 

你想挑战你的极限吗？那就给自己点压力。去测试下自己以前的极限到底有多准确。要确定一个能稍微超过力所能及的目标。

**You Are Stronger Than You Think** 

**你比自己想象的要强大**

Most people underestimate their strength. 

很多人低估了自己的能力。

As you go through your day, challenge your capacity. Test your limits. 

当你过每一天的时候，都要挑战一下你的能力，测试下自己的极限。

Push yourself, to find your true boundaries and define your strength. 

给自己施加点压力，找到你真正的极限，然后定义你的能力。

When you discover how much you’ve really got, you may surprise even yourself. 

当你发现你真正能获取的，你会发现自己都感到不可思议。

What are your self-imposed limits? Which do you need to push? When have you found that you were much stronger than you thought? 

你给自己强加的限制是什么？哪一方面需要你增加压力呢？到什么时候你会发现你比想象中要强大呢？

### 002残酷的生活教会了我什么？

The best and most amazing thing about life is that no matter what happens or how hard it may get, or how useless you feel, stay patient.

生活教会我们最伟大精深奥妙之处莫过于，不管眼下有多难，自己是多么的无用，你一定要耐心。





All you need to focus on is doing good even if it maybe the smallest thing like greeting someone with a smile it goes a long way, it can brighten up anyone's day, and you will have made the smallest yet biggest difference to someone's life they may carry on smiling because of you and spread peace and love and it all started with you! 

你要做的是，播种正能量，哪怕是微不足道的事情，就像问候他人的同时报以微笑。这个微笑的效果不会转瞬即逝，它会点亮别人一天的生活。一个小小的微笑也会成就一个大大地改变，人们会将它传递，而这一切都源于你最初的那个传递爱与和平的微笑。





I learned patience the hard way, I have been trying to rush through life [rapidly](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/rapidly), always comparing myself to my friends and family and wondering when my life would change I was too busy trying to speed things up but things just weren't moving, I finally gave up, but when I did I just continued to help people making people smile do what little I could everyday to make a difference.

 我吃了不少苦头才学会了耐心，以前我总是把自己的生活节奏搞得很快，总是把自己和家人朋友做比较，想着自己的生活何时会改变，急于看到起色，但是却毫无进展，最后我放弃了。当我仅仅为了让别人高兴才做事情，哪怕是一件力所能及的小事，才发现每一天都不一样了。





Life repays you back, well I believe God does he always looks after us no matter what, just carry on doing good spread love and peace and God will take care of you. 

生活会给你回报，我深信只要你做的事情关乎爱与和平，上天就会福佑你。





Keep your intentions sincere no matter how unjust people are towards you, I believe you will be successful, everything has a timing and yours is [definitely](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/definitely) coming, just need to wait a little longer.

不管其他人待你怎样不公，你依然要保持纯良。每件事情的发生都有它的时机，是你的也肯定会来，你需要的只是多等一会儿。





I did and I finally met someone worth it all, so kind and sweet so [thoughtful](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/thoughtful) always trying to surprise me in the most unexpected ways and everyday is better and that feeling is amazing then you realize it's because of all the good you kept doing in your life.

我等了，也遇到了那个值得我等待的人，TA是如此善良体贴，总是出其不意地给我惊喜。每一天都越来越好，那种感觉妙不可言，你会觉得这些都是因为你平时生活中累计善行的结果。





Even if it means you been doing bad things up until now you can change it all and make it all better, and believe me it always gets better. 

哪怕你做过什么不好的事情，只要你能够改邪归正。相信我，你的生活也会变好。





It's not easy but it will, I know because I have been struggling with it all and I finally feel better and I want to help many people feel great and amazing.

尽管这做起来并不容易，但是肯定会有成效。因为曾经我也经历过，一开始非常纠结，但是一切都变好了，我也要福泽更多人的体会到这样的乐成人美。

### 003.能承受委屈，才能承受责任

If life treats you unfairly.

如果生活对你不公。





Don't cry. Don't shout. Don't complain to anyone.

不要哭泣。不要叫嚷。也不要向任何人抱怨。





Because that's just how life is.

因为这就是生活。





It's never fair.

它从来就不是公平的。





Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time there were two boys.

让我来给你讲一个故事吧。从前，有两个男孩。





One of them was short and the other was tall.

他们其中一个很矮，而另一个很高。





They stood in front of a low wall and both wanted to see what was beyond that wall.

他们同时站在了一堵矮墙面前，都想看看墙那边是什么。





The taller one could easily do that but the shorter one needed to stand on a chair to reach the height.

个子高的那个很轻易就能做到，但个子矮的那个却需要站在椅子上才能达到同样的高度。





To the taller one the chair was only a chair.

对于个子高的那个，这个椅子只不过是个椅子。





But the shorter one called the chair Justice, because it made the situation "fair".

可矮的那个却把它称为“正义”，因为它带来了“公平”。





Well, real life is just like this. It's not fair.

其实真实的生活不就像是这样吗？它并不公平。





Most people complain about it and stop at just complaining about it, while a few others choose to bear this unfairness and try to discover their own strength.

大部分人会为此而抱怨，而且仅仅止步于抱怨；而还有一小部分人，他们选择承受这种不公，并试着发掘自己的力量。





And this second kind are the ones who have a chance to truly run the world.

只有这第二种人才有可能成为世界真正的主人。





Only by bearing unfairness can you bear responsibility.

你得承受得起委屈，才能承受得了责任。





That's how life works.

生活就是这么运作的。

### 004.家人是家人，你是你

A close friend of mine came to me recently.

我的一个很好的朋友最近来找我。





She said she felt tired. Really tired.

她说她觉得好累。真的好累。





Her family was starting to drive her crazy.

她的家人已经要把她逼疯了。





She wanted to live her own life. But her family always had some other plans for her.

她想过自己的生活。但她的家人总是为她安排了别的计划。





She has her own personality. But her family always wanted her to become someone else.

她有自己的个性，但她的家人总是希望她成为另外一个人。





And her choice was always to give in.

而她的选择，一直都是让步。





She doesn't want to hurt her family. So she chooses to compromise.

她不想伤害她的家人。所以她总是选择妥协。





And that's why she never felt happy.

这就是为什么她从来都不快乐。





I, on the other hand, am living a completely different life.

而另一方面，我过的是一种完全不同的生活。





I love my family. But I make my own dicisions.

我爱我的家人。但我自己做决定。





I am an independent individual. I have my boundaries that not even my family have the right to [trespass](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/trespass).

我是一个独立的人。我有自己的权力边界，即使是家人也无权跨越。





Yeah, some relatives don't like me because of this. And that's good.

没错，确实有一些亲戚因为这而不喜欢我。但这挺好的。





I can't please everyone and I don't plan to.

我不能让所有人都高兴，也不打算让所有人都高兴。





I tried to persuade that friend of mine to live like me.

我试着劝我这个朋友也像我这样生活。





But she's been hesitating.

但她一直在犹豫。





I don't know whether she will change or not eventually. I really hope she does. Because ever since I chose to live like this, my life has been getting better and better.

我不知道她终究会不会改变。我真心希望她会。因为自从我自己这样生活以后，我过得越来越好了。





It's really a good choice.

这真的是一个很棒的选择。

### 005.6个励志小故事 快乐就是这么简单(6)

**SLUSHY FILM MUSIC**

**音乐带来的快乐**





By Anthony Holden

安东尼·霍顿





The joys of family and friendship (not to mention poker) come top of my list.

家庭和友情给我带来的快乐是最多的（和家人朋友打牌就更不用说了）。





But for those of us who [savour](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/savour) the selfish pleasures of living alone, these days they are not always instantly available. Yet we can always go to the theatre. Or a (classical) concert.

但对于像我这样一人享受独居之乐的人来说，家人和朋友不是想找就马上能找到的，不过我们总是可以去剧院看戏或者去听（古典）音乐会。





The theatre has been my lifelong home from home, from the National Theatre and RSC via the West End to my grandchildren's school plays.

剧院永远是我的第二个家，无论是伦敦西区的国家大剧院和皇家莎士比亚剧团，还是我孙子孙女的学校剧场都不例外。





I will always remember my youngest son Ben, then nine, winning his school singing competition with a [feisty](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/feisty)[rendition](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/rendition) of Luck, Be A Lady Tonight! from our favourite musical Guys And Dolls.

我最小的儿子本九岁的时候在学校的歌唱比赛中获胜了。他精神抖擞地唱了一曲《Luck, Be A Lady Tonight!》（这是出自我们最喜欢的音乐剧《红男绿女》的歌），我永远都不会忘记当时的情景。





Fifteen years ago when I was [chronically](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/chronical) depressed after the failure of my second marriage, I could find [consolation](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/consolation) only in music - anything from Mozart's Cosi fan tutte to Ennio Morricone's sloshy theme from the film The Mission, Gabriel's Oboe.

十五年前，由于第二次婚姻的失败，我患上了严重的抑郁症，唯有音乐能给我慰藉——无论是莫扎特的《女人皆如此》还是恩尼奥·莫里科内为电影《教会》创作的主题曲，只要是音乐都能让我舒心。

### 006.后悔没在20几岁做这些事

Life is filled with regrets. Ask anyone around you what their regrets are and they usually have no difficulty coming up with many items on their “regret list.” And for some reason our twenties are ripe for a field of regrets. 

人生总是充满遗憾。问问你周围的人他们有没有遗憾的事情，他们会轻而易举的列出一大堆“遗憾清单”。由于某些原因，20多岁最容易犯错的年纪。





Perhaps it’s because as we get older we look back on that period of adulthood as the height of freedom and [autonomy](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/autonomy). As move into middle age, we look back and wish that we had made better choices and taken more opportunities. Here’s a list of things that we regret not doing in our 20s.

也许是因为随着年龄的增长，当我们再次回顾那段时光，会发现那是一段充满自由和独立的时光。随着我们步入中年，我们经常希望：要是我们能再有更多选择的机会多好啊！以下就列举了一些如果我们在20来岁没有做就会让我们后悔的事情：





**1. Travelling more**

**多旅行**





I regret not travelling more, and so does nearly everyone that I have asked. Before kids, and mortgages and marriages, when our commitments and expenses were lower, the opportunities for travel were much greater, but for some reason many of us thought we’d always have time for travel later. 

我后悔没有到更多的地方去旅行，而且几乎我问过的每个人都会这样说。在有孩子之前、在抵押贷款和结婚之前，在我们需要承担的责任和花销较少时，正是旅游的大好机，但是由于种种原因，我们总觉得我们以后会有更多的时间去旅行。





We dreamed of visiting the pyramids of Egypt, surfing off the Hawaiian coast, dining at a Parisian café, drinking espresso in Rome, trekking through the rainforest, and so much more. Sadly, many of us never made these journeys and the opportunity passed us by.

我们梦想过去埃及看金字塔，在夏威夷海边冲浪，在巴黎的咖啡馆共进晚餐，在罗马品尝香浓的咖啡，徒步穿越热带雨林等等诸如此类的计划。可悲的是，大部分人都没有付诸行动，只是看着机会白白溜走。





**2. Investing early** 

**早投资**





How many times have we kicked ourselves for not starting our 401Ks，in our twenties, for not putting our excess cash in long term investments, for not investing in our future early. No matter how much we try, we can never get back the head start that we missed. Playing catch up in our 40’s and 50’s is very difficult.

多少次回想我们都恨不得踢自己一脚：为什么不在20来岁就开始401K（小编注：美国的一种养老金制度）计划，为什么没有将多余的现金用于长期投资，为什么没有早早的为我们未来投资。不管我们再怎么努力，错过的时光都不会重来了。等到我们四五十岁的时候再奋起直追已为时已晚了。





**3. Being more responsible with spending**

**更合理的安排支出**





In order to invest in our retirement or save for that down payment, we would have needed to make wiser financial spending choices. Things like buying or holding on to that perfectly reliable used car, instead of splurging on the new model…because we could, eating out less and saving for a house instead, buying fewer shoes and purses and clothes and paying off student loans sooner. So many saving opportunities lost, money spent on tangible things, instead of on the future.

为了退休后的投资或房子的首付，我们需要更合理的理财。比如说买一辆不错的二手车，而不是把钱浪费在新款车型上……我们也可以减少外出就餐，攒钱买房子，少买点鞋子和衣服，提前还清助学贷款。这么多的攒钱机会都错过了，我们用钱换来了很多实实在在的物品，却没有更多关注我们的未来。





**4. Better planning**

**更好的规划人生**





I regret not focusing more on where I wanted to go in life, what I wanted to do, who I wanted to be and what it would take to get there. With some more planning in our twenties, we’d be further ahead in our 40s and perhaps a bit happier as well.

我后悔我没有仔细思考我的人生道路，我想要做的事情，我想成为一个什么样的人以及如何才能实现。如果在20多岁的时候我们能更好的规划人生，我们在40多岁的时候就会更上一层楼，也许还会感觉到更幸福。





**5. Seizing more experiences** 

**更多的人生体验**





I wish I had learned to ski and paint, speak Italian and do the Tango. I regret not living somewhere else before settling down. Others have said they regret not pursuing their hobbies or learning to sky dive or mountain climb. I prefer to stay on the ground, but I do regret not learning more, not trying new things that are hard to fit into the life of a forty something working wife and mother.

我多希望我以前学会了滑雪、画画，会说意大利语，会跳探戈。我后悔在安定下来之前没有在别的地方生活过。很多人也都和我一样后悔没有持之以恒的培养自己的爱好，没有学跳伞，没有去爬山。我确实更喜欢务实，但也很后悔没有去学更多的东西，没有尝试新事物，这些事物已经无法再融入一个40岁的全职妻子加母亲的生活中了。





**6. Living a more active lifestyle**

**更积极向上的生活方式**





The bodies of youth are wasted on the young… I wish I had run a marathon before my knees ached, that I had biked more, hiked more, and took spinning classes when my legs were stronger. I regret not joining a softball team or volleyball league. We don’t often realize that we have [squandered](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/squander) our physical abilities until things start aching and creaking.

年轻的时候，我们肆意的挥霍着我们的青春活力……我多想在我膝关节疼痛之前能跑场马拉松，多骑骑自行车、多走走看看，在腿脚强健的时候多骑骑动感单车。我后悔没有参加垒球社团或排球联盟。总是等到体力透支病痛来袭，我们才意识到年轻时锻炼的可贵。





**7. Making more friends**

**交更多的朋友**





I regret not reaching out more, putting more effort into creating a tribe of support that would carry me through more difficult times. We socialize sure, but many of us don’t put enough importance on building deep and lasting friendships. Some do, many don’t and wish they had.

我后悔没有更多的伸出手去，没有更努力去结交那么一伙儿可以陪我度过更多艰难时光的朋友。我们确实也有交际，但是大多数人并没有把重心放在建立更深更持久的友情上面。一些人做到了，但是还有很人却没有，他们希望当初曾为友情努力过。





**8. Pursuing a more meaningful career**

**追求一份更有意义的职业**





Many of us wish we had taken more career risks, opted for meaning over money, pursued the career path we wanted instead of what we were expected to do or simply following the path that was laid out before us. How much better to have explored our options and pursued meaningful work in our twenties than to have spent 20 years doing something we don’t love.

大部分人都是听从别人的期待去工作或者按照别人铺好的路去走，而不愿冒更多的职业风险和遵循我们的内心去工作挣钱。比起20多年一直从事自己不喜欢的工作，能在20多岁时自己选择并去追求一份更有意义的工作是多么的好啊！





Life is good; don’t misunderstand. Few of us walk around every day pining for our youth, at least I hope not, but we do occasionally look back with a wistful sigh and wish that we planned more, lived more, and stretched ourselves more when we had the freedom and energy to do so.

毋庸置疑，生活是美好的。很少有人每天四处走走缅怀我们的青春，但是我们确实会偶尔若有所思的边叹气边回忆：多么希望当我们身心自由和精力旺盛的时候，能有更多的计划、更多的活法去扩展自己。

### 007.被人评头论足也要做的10件事

What would you do differently if you knew nobody would judge you?

如果知道没有人在旁边指指点点，你会以一种的不同方式来做事吗？ 





Truth be told, no one has the right to judge you. People may have heard your stories, but they can’t feel what you are going through; they aren’t living YOUR life. So forget what they say about you. Focus on how you feel about yourself, and do what you know in your heart is right. 

事实上，没有人有指责你的权利。人们或许听过你的故事，但他们却不能感同身受，因为你的生活只属于你自己。所以忘掉他们对你的指责。相信自己的感觉，做自己认为正确的事。 



 



***\*1. Take care of yourself.\****

**照顾好自己。**





Your relationship with yourself is the closest and most important relationship you will ever have. If you don’t take good care of yourself, then you can’t take good care of others either; which is why taking care of yourself is the best selfish thing you can do. 

你和自己最亲近，是你所有关系中的重心。如果照顾不好自己，也就谈不上照顾好别人，这就是为什么说照顾好自己是你能做的最好的利己之事。 



 



**2. Do what you know is right, for YOU.**

**为了自己，去做自己认为正确的事情。**





Don’t be scared to walk alone, and don’t be scared to like it. Don’t let anyone’s [ignorance](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/ignorance), drama, or negativity stop you from being the best you can be. Keep doing what you know in your heart is right, for you. Because when you are totally at peace within yourself, nothing can shake you. 

不要害怕独行，不要因喜欢独行而害怕。不要让任何人的无知、恶搞或消极成为你达到巅峰的障碍。为了自己，坚持做你内心深处认为正确的事情。因为当你内心完全处于平和状态时，没有什么能让你动摇。 



 



***\*3. Follow your own unique path.\****

**沿自己独特的路走下去。**





Every new day is a chance to change your life. Work on making life all that you want it to be. Work hard for what you believe, and keep your dreams big and your worries small. You never need to carry more than you can hold; just take it one day at a time. And while you’re out there making decisions instead of excuses, learning new things, and getting closer and closer to your goals, you should know that there are others out there, like me, who admire your efforts and are striving for greatness too. 

新一天的到来为改变你的生活提供了契机。努力让生活之路朝着你所希望的方向延伸。为信仰辛勤工作，梦想远大思想放松。你永远不需要超负载工作，每天只需做力所能及的事。当你下定决心，而不是找借口时，当你学习新事物，且离目标越来越近时，你要知道，像我一样敬重你、并同样在追求卓越的人大有人在。 



 



***\*4. Lock yourself away from the world and work on your goals.\****

**远离外界的喧嚣，锁定既定目标。**





Dream big dreams, but realize that short term, realistic goals are the key to success. Success is directly connected with daily action. The way we spend our time defines who we are. Successful people keep moving, by doing small things every day that bring them a couple steps closer to their dream. They make mistakes along the way, but they don’t quit – they learn and press on. 

拥有很大的梦想，但要意识到切合实际的短期目标才是通向成功的关键。成功与日常工作密切相关。我们利用时间的方式也就决定了我们的未来。不积跬步无以至千里，成功的人不断前行，一步一步成就他们的梦想。他们犯了错误不退却，而是总结经验鞭策自己。 



 



***\*5. Adjust your goals and dreams as life changes.\****

**随时调整目标与梦想来适应生活。**





A great deal of pain in life comes from having a specific dream that you’ve fallen in love with, and when it doesn’t work out exactly as planned, you become angry that you now have to pursue a different path. If you want to tame your inner demons and make the most of life, you must not become rigidly attached to just one specific dream, and remain open to there being an even better, equally as happy path ahead. Life is [unpredictable](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/unpredictable), but it provides plenty of opportunities to make dreams come true. Just don’t forget that sometimes taking a positive step forward requires you to slightly adjust your dreams, or plan new ones – it’s OK to change your mind or have more than one dream.

生活中的很多痛苦来自于拥有一个明确的、让你无法自拔的梦想，当梦想不能如期实现时，你会感到气恼，不得不再去寻求另一种途径以期实现梦想。如果想让自己心平气和地过好每一天，你绝对不能固守一个特定的梦想，要向更美好的梦想敞开胸怀，正可谓幸福之路就在脚下。生活不可预知，但它却提供各种机遇，使你梦想成真。别忘记，有时对梦想略做些调整或构思一些新梦想，是向前迈出积极一步的必要条件——改变想法或拥有不只一个梦想不是件坏事情。 



 



**6. Forgive those who have wronged you.**

**宽恕曾误解你的人。**





Forgiveness is a gift you give yourself. Forgiveness is an attribute of the strong and wise. Forgiveness allows you to focus on the future without combating the past. To understand the potential of everything going forward is to forgive everything already behind you. Without forgiveness, wounds can never be healed, and moving on can never be accomplished. What happened in the past is just one chapter. Don’t close the book, just turn the page. 

宽恕是自己为自己送上的礼物。宽恕是强者和智者的品质。宽恕让你放手过去着眼未来。要理解正在发生发展的事物的潜力，就不要纠缠于过去。没有宽恕，伤口永远无法愈合，前进就是空谈。发生过的事仅是书中的一个章节。不要把书合上，请把它翻到下一页。 



 



***\*7. Show everyone your love and kindness.\****

**向大家表示你的友爱和友善。**





If you are reserving your love only for those who you have decided are worthy of it – all strangers excluded – it may come as a surprise to learn that this is not love at all, it is called judgment. Judgment is selective, love is all embracing. Just as the sunlight and the wind do not discriminate, true love does not make any such distinctions either. Love and kindness is a way of living. Where there is love, there is no judgment. Where there is judgment, there is no love. 

如果你只把爱留给那些你认为值得去爱的人，把所有陌生人被拒之门外，你可能会惊奇地发现，这根本不是爱，而是评判。评判是选择，爱是拥抱。真爱如阳光和风一样没有偏颇。爱与友善是一种生活方式，评判与爱不能共存。



 



***\*8. Stand up for others, even if it’s the unpopular thing to do.\****

**即使不被理解，也要为他人挺身而出。**





Sometimes you will say something really small and simple, but it will fit right into an empty space in someone’s heart. Dare to reach into the darkness, to pull someone else into the light. Remember, strong people stand up for themselves, but stronger people stand up for others too, and lend a hand when they’re able. 

有时一些实际上小而简单的话语，却会触动某个人的心灵。要敢于走入黑暗，将身处其中的人引向光明。记住，强者为自己挺身而出，但强者中强者会为他人挺身而出，而且在他们有能力时会向你伸出援手。 



 



**9\**. Fight through your failures.\****

**不服输。**





When you are feeling down or dealing with failure, don’t be ashamed. There’s nothing to be ashamed of. You are going through a difficult time, and you are still pushing forward. That’s something to be proud of – that you are fighting through it and slowly rising above it. Let everyone know that today you are a lot stronger than you were yesterday, and you will be. 

当你感到沮丧或面对失败时，不要感到羞愧。没有什么好羞愧的。你正在经历艰辛，你仍在前行。这是值得你骄傲的——你在努力战胜失败，一步步走出困境。让大家知道，今天的你比昨天更坚强，而且会越来越坚强。 



 



***\*10. Keep your head held high and keep on smiling.\****

**昂首挺胸，笑对人生。**





Every day of your life is a page of your history. The only time you run out of chances is when you stop taking them. Don’t cry over the past, cry to get over the past. Don’t smile to hide the pain, smile to heal the pain. Don’t think of all the sadness in the world, think of all the beauty that still remains around you. 

生活的每一天都会成为你历史的一页。当你停止捕捉机会时，机会弃你而去。不要为过去哭泣，含泪挥别过去。不要用微笑隐藏痛苦，要用微笑治愈痛苦。不要思虑世界的悲哀，要沉浸于身边的美好。  

### 008.遵从本心，做你自己

There will never be anyone else like you in the future of the universe. That's why being yourself is more important than anything else.

宇宙中再不会有一个人和你一样。这就是为什么做自己比什么都重要。





That's how life works: two steps forward, followed by one-and-a-half back as those who lost their power try to reverse the process.

生活就是这样：向前迈两步，接着后退一步半，而失去权势的人努力想要逆转这个顺序。





Those who benefit most from the status quo are naturally the least interested in change, and they find allies in the fearful and the [authoritarian](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/authoritarian). [Conformity](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/Conformity) always includes a threat of punishment if you fail to fit in, whether it comes from ridicule, being shunned by others, or direct attack.

从现状得益最多的人自然是最不希望改变的，他们与畏首畏尾者还有权威主义者结成联盟。如果你不能适应随大流，遵从一致往往有遭惩罚的风险，或是受人奚落，或是别人避之不及，甚至是受到直接攻击。





There’s a more [fundamental](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/fundamental) power behind the urgency with which authoritarian conservatives seek to suppress individuality. That power is lack of trust. Wise leaders and outstanding thinkers are alike in two things: they’re usually non-conformists —and they display a deep trust in the basic goodness, intelligence, and capacity for development of their fellow human beings.

权威主义派的保守者急不可耐要压抑个性有其更为根本的原因，那就是缺乏信任。明智的领导和杰出的思想家有两点是相似的：他们不随大流，他们对他人的本善、才智和能力发展表现出高度信任。





In [stark](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/stark) contrast, the most determined [proponents](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/proponent) of conformity have always been dictatorships. Under a dictatorship, any kind of variation from prescribed ways of thinking or acting is punished. Conservative thinkers often suggest too much freedom will lead to anarchy and the collapse of all standards.

与之对照鲜明的是，顺从最为顽固的要素在于独裁专制。在独裁控制下，凡有悖既定思维和有违既定行为者都会受到惩处。保守派思想常告诫，过度自由会引发混沌无序、会破坏标准。





Being who and what you are is the most natural thing there is. There may be a cost. Some people, even some friends, will disapprove of you as you truly are and will let you know it. There will be setbacks along the way. Yet the price for being yourself can never be as great as the price you will pay for stepping aside from your basic nature: a price paid in frustration, dissatisfaction, and the hopeless realization of all that you might have been, but now can never attain.

做自己是最自然的事情。也许会有代价，一些人，有些甚至是朋友，会不认可真实的你，并且告诉你，一路都会有挫折。但做自己的代价永远不会像违背你的本心代价那么大，背离自我的代价是挫败感、不满不悦、曾经可以企及的目标和愿望，如今却无望实现。





Take up the challenge. [Conformity](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/Conformity) has very little to recommend it. Trust yourself and trust others. Mediocrity and inner frustration are the true price of conforming. Only those with the courage openly to live their dreams can ever hope to find lasting satisfaction with their lives.

接受挑战吧。循规蹈矩没什么可以褒奖的。相信自己，相信他人。平庸无才和内心挫折才是默守陈规真正的代价。只有敢于实现梦想、心怀勇气的人才能在生命中获得源源不断的满足感。

### 010.去经历去体验，做最真实的自己

Truly happy and successful people get that way by becoming the best, most genuine version of themselves they can be. Not on the outside--on the inside. It's not about a brand, a reputation, a persona. It's about reality. Who you really are.

真正快乐成功的人会长成最好最真实的自己——从内心而非外表上。重要的不是品牌、名誉或者外表形象，而是真实的自我。





Sounds simple, I know. It is a simple concept. The problem is, it's very hard to do, it takes a lot of work, and it can take a lifetime to figure it out.

道理很简单，讲出来也很容易。但问题是，做起来就不简单了：这需要付诸很多努力，甚或一辈子才能实现。





Nothing worth doing in life is ever easy. If you want to do great work, it's going to take a lot of hard work to do it. And you're going to have to break out of your comfort zone and take some chances that will scare the crap out of you.

需要穷尽毕生精力的事情必定不容易。成大事者必先苦其心志。因此，你必须走出舒适区，去经历、去体验那些会让你害怕的机会。





But you know, I can't think of a better way to spend your life. I mean, what's life for if not finding yourself and trying to become the best, most genuine version of you that you can be?

况且，人这一辈子，若到头来都认不清自己、未能长成最好最真实的自己，还有什么意义呢？





That's what Steve Jobs meant when he said this at a Stanford University commencement speech:

正如史蒂夫-乔布斯在斯坦福大学的毕业典礼上所言：





Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.

时间宝贵，不要虚掷光阴过着他人的生活。不要让周遭的聒噪言论蒙蔽你内心的声音。





You have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something--your gut, destiny, life, [karma](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/karma), whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

你要相信，生活中的偶然冥冥中也能指引未来。你要心怀信念——相信你的直觉、命运、生活抑或因缘。这个方法一直给我力量，促使我过得卓然不同。





The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.

成大事的唯一途径就是做自己喜欢的事情。若你还没找到，那就继续追寻吧，不要停下来。





Now, let's for a moment be realistic about this. Insightful as that advice may be, it sounds a little too amorphous and challenging to resonate with today's [quick-fix](http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/quick-fix) culture. These days, if you can't tell people exactly what to do and how to do it, it falls on deaf ears.

现在我们来实际一点：建议或许很深刻，但听完却让人无从着手，难以运用到当今的快节奏文化中。现如今，如果一个建议讲不清具体做什么、该怎么做的话，那么说了也等于白说。





Not only that, but what Jobs was talking about, what I'm talking about, requires focus and discipline, two things that are very hard to come by these days. Why? Because, focus and discipline are hard. It's so much easier to give in to distraction and instant gratification. Easy and addictive.

不仅如此，乔布斯的讲话和我要说的话都需要集中和自制——这两个品质在当今社会非常难能可贵。何以见得？因为集中和自制都不容易做到。人们很容易分散注意力、寻求即时快感——舒服且容易上瘾。





To give you a little incentive to take on the challenge, to embark on the road to self-discovery, here are three huge benefits from working to become the best, most genuine version of yourself.

为激励你迎接挑战、踏上寻求自我的旅途，我列出了成为最好最真实自己后的三大益处：





It will make you happy. Getting to know yourself will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin. It will reduce your stress and anxiety. It will make you a better spouse, a better parent, a better friend. It will make you a better person. Those are all pretty good reasons, if you ask me.

你会感到快乐。了解自己后会让你更愉悦地接受自己，减轻你的压力和焦虑，使你成为更好的伴侣、父母、朋友，让你成为一个更美好的人。这些益处难道不够说服你为之努力吗？





Besides, you really won't achieve anything significant in life until you know the real you. Not your brand, your LinkedIn profile, how you come across, or what anyone thinks of you. The genuine you. There's one simple reason why you shouldn't try to be something you're not, and it's that you can't. The real you will come out anyway. So forget your personal brand and start spending time on figuring out who you really are and trying to become the best version of that you can be.

而且，只有了解真实的自己方能成就大事。你需要了解那个真实的你，而不是你的品牌、名誉、LinkedlIn资料、你的过去抑或他人对你的看法。为什么你不应该过他人的生活？很简单，因为首先你不是“其他人”，你的本性总有一天会现形。所以，请放开你的品牌形象，努力发掘真实自我、努力把自己经营成最好的自己吧。





You pay a huge price when you engage in mindless distraction. The only people that really care about you are your loved ones, your friends and family. Everyone else is too busy living his own little mini drama. To put it bluntly, your network couldn't care less about you.

盲目分心的代价很大。真正在乎你的只有你所爱的人、你的亲人和朋友。而其他人都只围着自己的小日子转罢了。说穿了，社交关系中的人并不可靠。





That's why engaging yourself and others in mindless distraction isn't worth your time or theirs. More important, it will absolutely keep you from focusing on accomplishing whatever great things you might manage to achieve in life if you set your mind to it.

所以，浪费时间盲目分心应付自己或他人都没有意义。更严重的是，当你决心着手生活中的大计划时，分心会有碍你集中完成目标。





There's a business concept called opportunity cost. When you choose one course of action, you miss out on all the other opportunities you might have chosen to pursue but didn't. People rarely stop to consider that until it's too late.

有一个商业术语叫“机会成本”。当你选定某个行为时，你也会错过其他原本可以选择的机会。很少有人能意识到这一点，就算意识到也为时已晚。





It's the most exciting journey you will ever embark on. We're all enthralled by adventure. We love to read and watch movies about other people's journeys, real or imagined. The Hobbit. Raiders of the Lost Ark. Into Thin Air.

这将是一段前所未有的有趣旅程。我们都乐于于冒险，热爱阅读和观看有关他人或真实或虚构的旅程电影，例如，《霍比特人》、《夺宝奇兵》或《走进空气稀薄地带》。





We love to take vacations, to travel to all sorts of places. And when we do, we revel in the natural beauty of Kauai's Na Pali Coast, the Grand Canyon, the Alps. We marvel at the great works of others: the art, the architecture, the Pyramids, Stonehenge.

我们热爱假期，喜欢到各地旅行。我们会惊叹于考艾岛上纳波利海岸的自然风光，迷上美国大峡谷、阿尔卑斯山。我们也会惊叹于他人的杰作：艺术、建筑、金字塔、巨石阵等等。





And yet, the opportunity for adventure is right there in front of each and every one of us. Until you take it, you'll never know what you might achieve. What marvels you might create. What you might discover. All you have to do is start the journey.

而且，冒险之门向每个人敞开。打开这扇门之前，谁也不知道能获得哪些收获，会创造哪些奇迹，又将有什么新的发现……你所要做的，仅仅是启程。[]

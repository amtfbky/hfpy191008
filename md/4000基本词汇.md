About the Books
The activities in these books are specially designed to make use of important
learning conditions. Firstly, the words are introduced using sentence definitions
and an example sentence. The activities that follow in the units encourage learners
to recall the meanings and forms of the words. Some activities also make the
learners think about the meaning of the words in the context of a sentence— a
sentence different from the sentences that occurred in the introduction of the words.
Moreover, each unit ends with a story containing the target words. While reading
the story, the learners have to recall the meanings of the words and suit them to the
context of the story. Such activities help learners develop a better understanding of
a common meaning for a given word which fits the different uses.

这些书中的活动是专门为利用学习条件。首先，使用句子定义介绍单词还有一个例句。单元中接下来的活动鼓励学习者回忆单词的意义和形式。一些活动也使学习者在句子的上下文中思考单词的意义句子不同于在引语中出现的句子。此外，每个单元以包含目标词的故事结尾。阅读时在这个故事中，学习者必须回忆单词的意思并使之适合故事的背景。这些活动有助于学习者更好地理解一个给定单词的共同意思，适合不同的用法。

Illustrations for each target word are provided to help learners visualize the word
as it is being used in the example sentence. These word/image associations aim
to help students grasp the meaning of the word as well as recall the word later.
It should be noted that words have more than one grammatical category. However,
this series focuses on the word’s most common form. This is mentioned to remind
learners that just because a word is labeled and utilized as a noun in this series
does not mean that it can never be used in another form such as an adjective.
This series has simply focused on the word in the form that it is most likely to be
expressed.

为每个目标单词提供插图，帮助学习者形象化单词就像在例句中一样。这些词/图像关联旨在帮助学生掌握单词的意思，并在以后回忆单词。应该注意的是，单词有不止一个语法范畴。然而，这一系列的重点是这个词最常见的形式。这是为了提醒学习者仅仅因为一个单词在这个系列中被标记和用作名词并不意味着它永远不能用在其他形式，如形容词。这一系列文章只关注这个词最有可能是表达。

Supporting Learning with Outside Activities
A well-balanced language course provides four major opportunities for learning:
learning through input, learning through output, deliberate learning, and fluency
development. The highly structured activities in these books support all four types
of learning opportunities. In addition, learning can further be supported through
the following activities:

通过外部活动支持学习

均衡的语言课程提供四大学习机会：
通过输入学习，通过输出学习，深思熟虑的学习和流利的语言发展。

这些书中高度结构化的活动支持所有四种类型学习机会。此外，学习还可以通过以下活动：

1 Have students create vocabulary cards with one word from the unit on one side of the card and the translation of the word in the student’s first language on the other side. Students should use the cards for study in free moments during the day. Over several weeks, students will find that quick repeated studying for brief periods of time is more effective than studying for hours at one sitting.
2 Assign graded readers at students’ appropriate levels. Reading such books provides both enjoyment as well as meaning-focused input which will help the words stick in students’ memory.
3 Practice reading fluency to promote faster recall of word meaning for both sight recognition and usage. Compass Publishing’s Reading for Speed and Fluency is a good resource for reading fluency material.
4 Include listening, speaking, and writing activities in classes. Reinforcement of the high-frequency vocabulary presented in this series is important across all the four language skills.

让学生制作词汇卡片，卡片的一边是单元中的一个单词，另一边是学生母语中单词的翻译。学生应该在白天的空闲时间使用卡片学习。几个星期后，学生们会发现，**短时间快速重复学习**比一次坐几个小时更有效。
2在学生的适当水平上分配分级读者。阅读这类书籍既能提供乐趣，又能提供注重意义的输入，这将有助于单词在学生的记忆中留下痕迹。
3练习**阅读流畅性**，以促进视觉识别和使用中更快的词义回忆。指南针出版社的阅读速度和流畅性是阅读流畅性材料的良好资源。
4包括课堂上的听、说、写活动。强化本系列中的高频词汇对所有四种语言技能都很重要。

## 																The Lion and the Rabbit

A cruel lion lived in the forest. Every day, he killed and ate a lot of animals. The other animals were afraid the lion would kill them all.
The animals told the lion, “ Let’s make a deal. If you promise to eat only one animal each day, then one of us will come to you every day. Then you don’t have to hunt and kill us.”
The plan sounded well thought-out to the lion, so he agreed, but he also said, “ If you don’t come every day, I promise to kill all of you the next day!”
Each day after that, one animal went to the lion so that the lion could eat it. Then, all the other animals were safe.
Finally, it was the rabbit’s turn to go to the lion. The rabbit went very slowly that day, so the lion was angry when the rabbit finally arrived.
The lion angrily asked the rabbit, “Why are you late?”
“ I was hiding from another lion in the forest. That lion said he was the king, so I was afraid.”
The lion told the rabbit, “ I am the only king here! Take me to that other lion, and I will kill him.
The rabbit replied, “ I will be happy to show you where he lives.”
The rabbit led the lion to an old well in the middle of the forest. The well was very deep with water at the bottom. The rabbit told the lion, “ Look in there. The lion lives at the bottom.”
When the lion looked in the well, he could see his own face in-the water. He thought that was the other lion. Without waiting another moment, the lion jumped into the well to attack the other lion. He never came out.
All of the other animals in the forest were very pleased with the rabbit’s clever trick.

狮子和兔子
森林里住着一只残忍的狮子。每天，他杀死并吃掉很多动物。其他的动物害怕狮子会把它们都杀了。
动物们对狮子说：“我们做个交易吧。如果你答应每天只吃一只动物，那么我们中的一个每天都会来找你。那你就不必猎杀我们了。”
这个计划在狮子看来是经过深思熟虑的，所以他同意了，但他也说：“如果你们不每天来，我保证第二天就杀了你们所有人！“。”
在那之后的每一天，都有一只动物去找狮子，以便狮子能吃掉它。那么，所有其他动物是安全的。
最后，轮到兔子去找狮子了。那天兔子走得很慢，所以当兔子终于来的时候狮子很生气。
狮子生气地问兔子：“你为什么迟到？“。”
“我在森林里躲避另一头狮子。那只狮子说他是国王，所以我很害怕。”
狮子对兔子说：“我是这里唯一的国王！把我带到另一头狮子那里，我就杀了他。
兔子回答说：“我很乐意告诉你他住在哪里。”
兔子把狮子领到森林中间的一口老井里。井很深，井底有水。兔子对狮子说：“看里面。狮子生活在底部。”
当狮子往井里看时，他能看见自己在水里的脸。他以为那是另一头狮子。没等片刻，狮子就跳进井里去攻击另一只狮子。他从来没出来过。
森林里所有其他的动物都对兔子的聪明把戏很满意。

## 					The Laboratory

Mia’s father had a laboratory, but she had no idea what was in it. Her dad always closed and locked the door when he went in. She knew that he used it to do projects for work. He never told Mia what these projects were.
One night, Mia approached the door to the laboratory. She stopped and thought, “ I wonder what crazy experiment he is doing now.” Suddenly, she heard a loud noise. It sounded like an evil laugh. The noise scared her, so she walked quickly back to her room.
The next night, her friend Liz came to her house. When Liz arrived, Mia told her about the night before. “ Oh, it was terrible,” she said.
“Why don’t we see what is in there?” Liz asked. “ It will be a fun adventure!”
Mia felt nervous about going into her father’s laboratory, but she agreed. As always, the door was locked. They waited until Mia’s father left the laboratory to eat dinner. “ He didn’t lock the door!” Liz said. “ Let’s go.”
The laboratory was dark. The girls walked down the stairs carefully. Mia smelled strange chemicals. What terrible thing was her father creating?
Suddenly, they heard an evil laugh. It was even worse than the one Mia heard the night before. What if a monster was going to kill them? Mia had to do something. She shouted for help.
Mia’s father ran into the room and turned on the lights. “ Oh, no,” he said. “You must have learned my secret.” “Your monster tried to kill us,” Mia said.
“ Monster?” he asked. “You mean this?” He had a pretty doll in his hands. The doll laughed. The laugh didn’t sound so evil anymore. “ I made this foryour birthday. I wanted to give it to you then, but you can have it now. I hope you like it!”

实验室
米娅的父亲有一个实验室，但她不知道里面有什么。她爸爸进屋时总是关上门。她知道他用它来做工作项目。他从来没有告诉米娅这些项目是什么。
一天晚上，米娅走近实验室的门。她停下来想：“我想知道他现在在做什么疯狂的实验。”突然，她听到一声巨响。听起来像是恶笑。噪音把她吓坏了，所以她很快就走回房间。
第二天晚上，她的朋友利兹来到她家。利兹来的时候，米娅告诉她前一天晚上的事。“哦，太可怕了，”她说。
“我们为什么不看看里面是什么？利兹问。“这将是一次有趣的冒险！“。”
米娅对进入她父亲的实验室感到紧张，但她同意了。像往常一样，门是锁着的。他们一直等到米娅的父亲离开实验室吃晚饭。“他没有锁门！利兹说。“我们走吧。”
实验室里一片漆黑。姑娘们小心翼翼地走下楼梯。米娅闻到了奇怪的化学物质。她父亲制造了什么可怕的事情？
突然，他们听到一声邪恶的笑声。这比米娅前一天晚上听到的更糟。如果一个怪物要杀了他们呢？米娅不得不做点什么。她大声呼救。
米娅的父亲跑进房间，打开了灯。“哦，不，”他说。“你一定知道我的秘密了。”“你的怪物想杀了我们，”米娅说。
“怪物？”他问。“你是说这个？“他手里拿着一个漂亮的洋娃娃。洋娃娃笑了。笑声听起来不再那么邪恶了。“这是我为你做的生日礼物。我当时想给你，但你现在可以了。希望你喜欢！“。”

## 					The Report

Lee sat among the books at the library and thought about his group project.
They had to turn it in soon, but he hadn’t even started his part! Jack and Claire were in his group. They had worked hard. They were also very smart, and Lee didn’t want them to get a bad grade.
Jack did the report. He wrote a lot of very good sentences and described things with great adjectives. Claire drew a nice map of the stars. Now, Lee needed to do his part of the project.
“Well, I suppose I need to start my model,” Lee thought.
Making a model of a planet was really hard. Lee tried to read several books, but he couldn’t comprehend any of the charts. “We’re going to fail because of me!” Lee said. He put his head down on the table and said, “ I wish I could see a planet, instead of having to read about it!”
Suddenly, there was a bright light. Lee was pulled from his chair, through the roof, and right into a strange ship! “ Hello, kid,” said an alien. “ Did you ask for help?”
Lee told the friendly alien all about his project. The alien agreed to help Lee solve his problem. “ First, we’ll fly through space to view the universe. Then, I canhelp you make a model of my planet.”
Soon, they were going through the clouds. They passed the moon. Then they viewed Mars. Lee was very excited. Instead of a bad grade, his group would have the best project ever!
“ It’s time to go home,” the alien finally said. On the way back, he helped Lee make a model of the planet Mars. Soon, they were on Earth.
“Thanks,” Lee said. “ My model will be awesome!” Then he took his model and said goodbye to his new friend.

报告
李坐在图书馆的书中间，思考着他的集体项目。
他们很快就得把它交上来，但他连角色都还没开始呢！杰克和克莱尔在他的小组里。他们工作很努力。他们也很聪明，李不想让他们得到坏成绩。
杰克做了报告。他写了很多很好的句子，用很好的形容词来形容事物。克莱尔画了一张很好的星图。现在，李需要完成他的部分工程。
“好吧，我想我需要开始我的模型，”李想。
制作一个行星模型真的很难。李想读几本书，但他一本也看不懂。“我们会因为我而失败！”李说。他把头放在桌子上说：“我希望我能看到一个星球，而不是去读它！“。”
突然，有一道亮光。李被从椅子上拉了下来，穿过屋顶，直接撞上了一艘奇怪的船！“你好，孩子，”一个外星人说。“你请求帮助了吗？“。”
李把他的计划告诉了友好的外星人。外星人同意帮助李解决他的问题。“首先，我们将飞越太空去观察宇宙。那么，我可以帮你做一个我星球的模型。”
很快，他们穿过云层。他们经过月球。然后他们看了火星。李很兴奋。而不是一个糟糕的成绩，他的小组将有史以来最好的项目！
“该回家了，”外星人终于说。在回来的路上，他帮助李制作了火星的模型。很快，他们就来到了地球上。
“谢谢，”李说。“我的模特会很棒的！“然后他拿着他的模特和他的新朋友道别。

## 					The Dog’s Bell

John’s dog was a bad dog. He bit people frequently. John had great concern about this. It was not an appropriate way for a dog to behave. His friends in the village always expected the dog to bite them. The news about John’s dog spread
through the village. None of the people wanted to go to John’s house.
John tried to instruct the dog to behave, but it never worked. He tried to be patient and teach the dog to be calm. That also didn’t work. John didn’t want to punish the dog. “ How will I stop my dog’s bad habit?” John asked himself.
John’s friend came to talk to him about the issue. During their important meeting, his friend said, “The people in the village asked me to represent them. We want your dog to stop this habit. Why don’t you put a bell around the dog’s neck? This way, we would hear your dog coming down the street.”
John thought this was a great idea. Now, people could stay away from the dog. It would not be able to bite anyone anymore.
The dog liked the bell, too. People looked at him when they heard his bell. This made the dog very content. He liked the song the bell played when he walked.
One day, John’s dog strolled through the village and met some other dogs. He expected them to want a bell like his. But they laughed at his bell. They said the bell made people avoid him. John’s dog shook his head. “ No, they look at me because they like the bell.”
The other dogs said, “You have the wrong idea of what makes you popular. Of course they like your bell. It tells them where you are so they can avoid you. You aren’t able to bite them anymore!”
You see, being popular isn’t something positive when it’s for the wrong reason.

狗铃
约翰的狗是条坏狗。他经常咬人。约翰对此非常担心。对狗来说，这不是一种适当的行为方式。他在村里的朋友总是指望狗咬他们。关于约翰的狗的消息传开了
穿过村庄。没有人想去约翰家。
约翰试图教那条狗举止得体，但一直没有成功。他试着耐心地教狗冷静。那也没用。约翰不想惩罚那条狗。“我怎样才能戒掉我的狗的坏习惯呢？约翰问自己。
约翰的朋友来和他谈这个问题。在他们的重要会议上，他的朋友说：“村里的人请我代表他们。我们要你的狗戒掉这个习惯。你为什么不给狗脖子上套个铃铛呢？这样，我们就能听到你的狗在街上跑来。”
约翰认为这是个好主意。现在，人们可以远离狗了。它不会再咬任何人了。
那条狗也喜欢这个铃铛。人们听到他的铃声就看着他。这使狗很满足。他喜欢他走路时铃响的那首歌。
一天，约翰的狗在村子里散步，遇到了其他一些狗。他希望他们想要一个和他一样的铃铛。但他们嘲笑他的铃声。他们说铃声让人们避开他。约翰的狗摇摇头。“不，他们看着我是因为他们喜欢铃声。”
其他的狗说：“你不知道什么让你受欢迎。他们当然喜欢你的铃铛。它告诉他们你在哪里，这样他们就可以避开你。你不能再咬他们了！“。”
你看，受欢迎不是一件积极的事情，当它是因为错误的原因。

## 			The Jackal and the Sun Child

A jackal is a wild dog with a big black back. It resides in the desert. But how did the jackal get his black back? This was how it happened.
One day, the jackal saw a girl. She was sitting upon a rock. She was not a normal child. She was a rare and beautiful sun child. She was bright and warm like the sun. The child saw the jackal and smiled.
She said, “Jackal, I have been relaxing on this rock for too long. I must get home soon. But, I am slow and you are fast. You will likely get me home more quickly.” Then she requested, “Will you carry me home? If you do, I’ll give you a gift. This necklace belongs to me, but I will give it to you.”
The wild jackal agreed. So the sun child sat on the dog’s back. They started to walk. But soon, the jackal felt ill. The sun child was very hot on his back. The heat was hurting his back very badly. “ I made a terrible error in judgment.” he thought. He shouldn’t have agreed to carry her. So he asked her to get off.
But she did not. The jackal’s back continued to get hotter and hotter. He had to get away from the sun child. So he made a plan. First, he ran as fast as he could. He hoped the sun child would fall off. But she did not. So when the
sun child was looking at the sky, not aware of the jackal’s next plan, he jumped into a field of flowers. As a result, the child rolled off his back. The jackal ran away.
But the sun child left a mark on the jackal’s back, a visible black mark. Ever since his experience with the sun child, the jackal has had a black back.

豺狼和太阳孩子
豺狼是一种背大而黑的野狗。它住在沙漠里。但是豺狼是怎么回来的？事情就是这样发生的。
一天，豺狼看见一个女孩。她坐在一块岩石上。她不是一个正常的孩子。她是一个罕见而美丽的阳光孩子。她像太阳一样明亮温暖。孩子看到豺狼，笑了。
她说：“Jackal，我在这块石头上放松太久了。我必须很快回家。但是，我很慢，你很快。“你很可能会更快地送我回家。”然后她问，“你能带我回家吗？”如果你愿意，我会给你一份礼物。这条项链是我的，但我会给你的。”
野豺狼同意了。所以太阳孩子坐在狗背上。他们开始走了。但很快，豺狼感到不舒服。那个晒太阳的孩子背上很烫。热得他背疼得很厉害。“我在判断上犯了一个可怕的错误。”他想。他不应该同意背着她。所以他让她下车。
但她没有。豺狼的背越来越热。他必须离开太阳孩子。所以他制定了一个计划。首先，他跑得尽可能快。他希望太阳孩子会掉下来。但她没有。所以当
太阳子看着天空，不知道豺狼的下一个计划，他跳进了一片花丛。结果，孩子从背上滚了下来。豺狼跑了。
但是太阳孩子在豺狼的背上留下了一个明显的黑色痕迹。自从他和太阳孩子的经历，豺狼有一个黑色的背部。

## The Best Prince

King Minos was very sick. His condition was getting worse. He had three sons. He loved them all. He had to announce who would become king.
Two of the princes stood waiting outside the king’s room. Theseus was the oldest and strongest. He thought his father would make him king. Pelias, the second son, thought differently. He was an expert with weapons. He thought the king would choose him.
“When I’m king,” Theseus told Pelias, “ I’ll let you contribute to the defense of our country. You can lead the army.”
Pelias became angry. “ Father knows I’m famous for my sword skills. He’ll make me king.”
“You?” Theseus yelled. “ He won’t choose you!”
“The kingdom is mine!” Pelias claimed. “ Father will give it to me—or I’ll use force to take it!”
Theseus made a sudden move to take out his sword. Then Pelias did the same. “ Beating me will be a challenge,” Theseus said. “ Fight me now. The winner gets the kingdom!”
Pelias agreed.
King Minos could hear his sons fighting. The youngest son, Jason, stood beside him. He sensed his father’s sadness. The king laid his hand flat on Jason’s arm.
“Your brothers fight too much,” the king told him. “ I must protect my kingdom from all harm. They’ll divide it between them. The people won’t know what to do. There’ll be war. I can’t allow either of them to be king. Therefore, I’m making you king. Your kindness has always made you special. It’s the difference between you and your brothers. You can bring peace. They can’t.”
Then the king died. Theseus and Pelias heard that their youngest brother was king. They were surprised. They realized that their fighting was wrong. It had kept them from saying goodbye to their father. They agreed to have Jason as their king. He was the best choice.

最好的王子
米诺斯国王病得很重。他的情况越来越糟。他有三个儿子。他爱他们所有人。他必须宣布谁将成为国王。
两位王子站在国王的房间外等着。忒修斯是最老最强壮的。他以为他父亲会立他为国王。第二个儿子贝利亚斯的想法不同。他是个武器专家。他以为国王会选他。
“当我是国王的时候，”忒修斯对佩利亚斯说，“我会让你为保卫我们的国家做出贡献。你可以领导军队。”
佩利亚斯生气了。“父亲知道我以剑术闻名。他会让我成为国王的。”
“你呢？”忒修斯喊道。“他不会选你的！“。”
“王国是我的！“佩利亚斯声称。“爸爸会把它给我的，否则我会用武力夺走它！“。”
忒修斯突然采取行动拿出他的剑。彼利亚斯也这样做了。“打败我将是一个挑战，”忒修斯说。“现在就跟我打。赢家得到王国！“。”
佩利亚斯同意了。
米诺斯国王能听到他的儿子们在战斗。小儿子杰森站在他旁边。他感觉到他父亲的悲伤。国王把手平放在杰森的手臂上。
“你的兄弟们打得太多了，”国王告诉他。“我必须保护我的王国不受任何伤害。他们会把钱分给他们的。人们不知道该怎么办。会有战争。我不能让他们中的任何一个当国王。所以，我要让你成为国王。你的善良总是让你与众不同。这是你和你兄弟之间的区别。你可以带来和平。他们不能。”
国王死了。忒修斯和庇利亚听说他们最小的兄弟是国王。他们很惊讶。他们意识到他们的战斗是错误的。这使他们无法向父亲道别。他们同意让杰森做他们的国王。他是最好的选择。最好的王子

## 		How the Sun and the Moon Were Made

Do you ever wonder where the moon and the sun came from? The Inuit people of Alaska have a theory.
They tell a story about a beautiful girl. She was very nice. In contrast, her brother was a mean little boy. One day he proposed something. “We should go to a party,” he said. The girl accepted. First, it was necessary for her to prepare. She arranged her hair and put on nice clothes. This required a lot of time. But the girl worked hard, and soon she had success. She looked perfect.
They attended the party together. The girl was having fun. Later, she walked into the bathroom. Suddenly, the lights were turned off! Someone grabbed her hair and tore her clothes. She ran out of the bathroom. She wanted to know who
did this to her.
Then she had an idea. She fixed her hair again. This time it was even more beautiful. She even balanced beautiful jewels in it. She wanted to encourage the person to grab it again. She put black dirt in her hair. The purpose of this was to catch the person.
She went to the bathroom again, and it was the same pattern. The lights went off, and someone grabbed her hair. When he released it, his hand was black. The girl returned to the party. She knew there was only a single person with a black hand. When she saw that person, he was very familiar. It was her brother!
He ran into the woods. The girl ran after him. They both carried fire so they could see in the dark. The smoke went into the air. As they ran, they grew. They became huge. Then they went into space. When the girl’s fire went out, she hung in the sky. She became the moon, and her brother became the sun. They chase each other forever.

太阳和月亮是如何形成的
你想过月亮和太阳是从哪里来的吗？阿拉斯加的因纽特人有一个理论。
他们讲了一个关于一个漂亮女孩的故事。她很好。相比之下，她哥哥是个吝啬的小男孩。有一天他提出了一些建议。“我们应该去参加一个聚会，”他说。女孩接受了。首先，她必须做好准备。她整理好头发，穿上漂亮的衣服。这需要很多时间。但是这个女孩很努力，很快就成功了。她看起来很完美。
他们一起参加了聚会。那女孩玩得很开心。后来，她走进浴室。突然，灯关了！有人抓住她的头发撕破了她的衣服。她跑出浴室。她想知道谁
对她做了这些。
然后她有了一个主意。她又把头发修好了。这次更美了。她甚至把漂亮的珠宝放在里面。她想鼓励那个人再抓住它。她在头发上撒了黑灰。这是为了抓住那个人。
她又去了洗手间，也是这样。灯灭了，有人抓住她的头发。当他松开它时，他的手是黑色的。女孩回到了聚会上。她知道只有一个人黑手。当她看到那个人时，他非常熟悉。是她哥哥！
他跑进了树林。那女孩追着他跑。他们都带着火以便在黑暗中能看见。烟飘向空中。他们一边跑，一边成长。它们变得巨大。然后他们进入太空。女孩的火熄灭时，她悬在空中。她成了月亮，她哥哥成了太阳。他们永远互相追逐。

## 					The Starfish

Last summer I took a trip to an island. I had a lot of fun. I sat and watched the waves and listened to the ocean. I learned to identify birds. I discovered pretty things and enjoyed the taste of new foods. It was a very nice time.
One evening I took a pleasant walk by the ocean. When the waves came in, many starfish* fell on the beach. Some starfish went back into the water, and they were safe. But other starfish were still on the sand. They would die if they did not get into the water. There were many starfish on the beach that night. It made me sad, but I knew I could not fix the problem. I stepped very carefully so I did not damage them.
Then I saw a little girl. She was also sad about the starfish. She wanted to prevent all of them from dying. She asked me if I could perhaps help her.
“To be frank, I don’t think we can do anything,” I said.
The little girl started to cry. She sat back against a rock and thought for a while. Finally, the emotion was gone. She stopped crying and stood up. Then she picked up a starfish and threw it into the water.
“What are you doing?” I asked her. But she did not answer me. She just threw as many starfish as she could. “You cannot save all of them!” I said.
She stopped to look at me. “ No, I cannot save them all,” she replied. Then she picked up a very big starfish and said, “ But I can save this one.” And then she smiled and threw the starfish as far as she could into the ocean.

海星
去年夏天我去了一个岛。我玩得很开心。我坐着看海浪，听大海的声音。我学会了辨认鸟类。我发现了漂亮的东西，喜欢新食物的味道。那是一段非常美好的时光。
一天晚上，我在海边愉快地散步。当海浪袭来时，许多海星落在海滩上。一些海星回到水里，它们很安全。但其他海星仍在沙滩上。如果他们不下水，他们会死的。那天晚上海滩上有许多海星。这让我很难过，但我知道我不能解决这个问题。我走得很小心，所以没有弄坏他们。
然后我看到一个小女孩。她也为海星感到难过。她想阻止他们全部死去。她问我是否可以帮她。
“坦白说，我觉得我们无能为力，”我说。
小女孩哭了起来。她靠在一块石头上，想了一会儿。最后，情感消失了。她停止哭泣，站了起来。然后她捡起一条海星扔到水里。
“你在干什么？”我问她。但她没有回答我。她尽可能多地扔海星。“你救不了他们！“我说。
她停下来看着我。“不，我不能救他们所有人，”她回答说。然后她拿起一只非常大的海星说：“但我能救这只。”然后她微笑着把海星尽可能地扔到海里。

## 					The First Peacock

Argos lived in Ancient Greece. He was a husband and a proud father. He worked hard and did well at his job. But one thing about him wasn’t normal. He was born with 100 eyes. Having many eyes was usually a benefit to him. He had a chance to see many things.
Also, since he had so many eyes, he was very good at guarding things. While sleeping, he only rested a few eyes at a time. The others stayed awake. He worked for Hera, a great goddess. His primary function was to guard a special cow. The cow was very important to Hera. It was her favorite pet. The most essential part of his job was to keep the cow alone. It had to be kept separate from all the other cows and far away from people.
This was an easy job for Argos. The cow just ate grass all day. But the god Zeus wanted the cow. He wanted to take it away from Hera. He had a plan. He found a great music player. He asked the man to play a beautiful song for Argos. Zeus was certain Argos would go to sleep.
The song had an immediate effect. Argos couldn’t focus on his job. He fell asleep. Zeus saw this, and he took the cow.
Hera was very angry with Argos. She turned him into a peacock. She put his many eyes on his tail. Argos was very sad.
Zeus saw how much trouble he had caused Argos. He made another plan. He turned Argos into a group of stars. He wanted
Argos to remain in the sky forever. Even today, Argos’ image remains there, above the site where all his problems began. We can still see him in the night sky.

这对阿戈斯来说是件容易的事。奶牛整天都在吃草。但是宙斯想要那头牛。他想把它从赫拉手里夺走。他有个计划。他找到了一个很棒的音乐播放器。他请那人为阿戈斯演奏一首优美的歌曲。宙斯确信阿戈斯会睡着。
这首歌立竿见影。阿戈斯不能专注于他的工作。他睡着了。宙斯看见了，就把牛带走了。
赫拉对阿戈斯很生气。她把他变成了一只孔雀。她把他的许多眼睛放在他的尾巴上。阿戈斯很伤心。
宙斯看到他给阿戈斯带来了多大的麻烦。他又做了一个计划。他把阿戈斯变成了一群星星。他想要
永远留在天空中。即使到了今天，阿戈斯的形象仍然在那里，在他所有问题开始的地方。我们仍然可以在夜空中看到他。

## 			Princess Rose and the Creature

There was once a beautiful princess named Rose. Her mother, the queen, however, was not as beautiful as the princess. The queen felt bad that she was not the most beautiful woman in the kingdom anymore. She was tired of competing with her daughter. She made a decision. She prepared a drink for the princess. After the princess drank it, she fell asleep. Then the queen took the princess to the forest. She left the princess there. It was a very serious thing to do. “ Either she will be killed by animals or she will get lost in the forest,” the queen thought.
The princess had a dream. She dreamed about a man with brown hair and brown eyes. It was the man she would wed.
The princess woke up. She saw a strange creature on the ground. It looked like a man, but he was hairy and green. He had horns on his head and a pig’s nose.
The creature said, “ Did I scare you? I hope not. Let me introduce myself. I am Henry.”
“ I am not scared. To tell you the truth, I think you are cute,” said Rose.
Rose and Henry spent the day together. They collected berries, caught fish, and had lunch. They had a very good day
filled with nice conversations.
“ Rose, I have to go home,” said Henry. “ My ship will sail home soon. I can’t leave you here in the forest alone. Will you come with me?”
Rose was very happy. She gave Henry a kiss right on his pig nose. As soon as she kissed Henry, he began
to change. His pig nose turned into a man’s nose. His horns and green hair went away. Standing in front of her was the man Rose had dreamt about.
Rose and Henry were married, and they lived happily.

Soon Frenhofer became very thin. But he kept working on the same painting for many years. He worked as hard as he could.
Finally, he finished the painting. He was very happy and invited other artists to see it. “ I want your professional opinion,” he said. He wanted them to judge it and compare it to other paintings. Everyone was very excited as they went up the stairs to his apartment. Frenhofer was excited to show his painting, and the artists were excited to see it. “They’ll love it,” he thought. But they did not.
They were surprised by his painting. There was no white anywhere. Frenhofer filled the whole painting with lines and colors. There was no space for a normal picture. It was full of strange shapes. It looked bad to the other artists. He used symbols, and they didn’t understand them. They thought it was terrible. “Why did you paint this strange picture?” someone asked. They didn’t understand its beauty.
But after some time, many people began to like his painting. People wrote articles about it in magazines. They said it was his best work. They loved his strange symbols. They loved his strange colors. Frenhofer’s painting reminded everyone that just because something was new didn’t mean that it was bad. He also helped them to realize that sometimes it takes people a little time to understand great things.Answer the questions.

但过了一段时间，许多人开始喜欢他的画。人们在杂志上写了关于它的文章。他们说这是他最好的作品。他们喜欢他的奇怪符号。他们喜欢他奇怪的颜色。弗伦霍费尔的画提醒每个人，仅仅因为一些新的东西并不意味着它是坏的。他还帮助他们认识到，有时人们需要一点时间来理解伟大的事情。回答问题。

## 				The Farmer and the Cats

Arthur was a responsible farmer, and Maria was a nice lady. But they were poor. They owed the town lord money for their land. One summer, their farm burned. One structure caught fire, and most of the animals ran away. Only the cats stayed. So Arthur and Maria had to bring in their crops without an animal’s help.
On a fall day, the lord demanded his money. Arthur asked if the lord could wait until he brought in his crops.
The lord was angry. He raised his hands high and yelled, “ Pay me by the end of the week. If you don’t, I will increase the money you have to pay. I might put you in a jail cell.”
So Arthur and Maria worked until there was blood on their hands. They finished four lines of corn and went to bed.
But the next morning, eight lines were finished! “ Maria, didn’t we stop in this spot here?” Arthur asked.
“Yes, that is correct. And the tools were in a different position, too,” Maria said. They were surprised and happy. That day, they worked hard and finished five lines.
But in the morning, ten lines were done! Each day they did a lot of work. Each night, someone else did an equal amount of work. In a week, the whole field was finished. “Tomorrow I will sell the crops and pay the lord,” Arthur said. But that morning, the crops were gone. A bag was in the middle of the field. It contained money.
“ Maria, let’s see who has helped us work.” Through a hole in the wall, they saw a funny sight. The cats were dancing in the field and eating corn! Now Arthur knew what had happened. The cats had worked at night! After that, Arthur was very nice to his cats and fed them lots of corn.

农夫和猫
亚瑟是一个负责任的农夫，玛丽亚是一个好女人。但他们很穷。他们欠城主土地的钱。一年夏天，他们的农场被烧毁。一个建筑着火了，大多数动物都跑掉了。只有猫留下来了。所以亚瑟和玛丽亚不得不在没有动物帮助的情况下把庄稼运进来。
在秋天的一天，上帝要了他的钱。亚瑟问上帝是否可以等到他把庄稼带来。
上帝很生气。他高举双手喊道：“周末前给我钱。如果你不这样做，我会增加你必须支付的钱。我可能会把你关进牢房。”
所以亚瑟和玛丽亚一直工作到手上有血为止。他们吃完四行玉米就上床睡觉了。
但是第二天早上，八行已经排完了！“玛丽亚，我们不是停在这里吗？“亚瑟问。
“是的，没错。工具也在不同的位置，”玛丽亚说。他们既惊讶又高兴。那天，他们努力工作，完成了五行。
但是到了早上，已经排了十行了！他们每天都做很多工作。每天晚上，都有人做同样多的工作。一周内，整个场地都完工了。亚瑟说：“明天我会把庄稼卖了，还上帝钱。但那天早上，庄稼不见了。一个袋子在地中央。里面有钱。
“玛丽亚，让我们看看是谁帮助我们工作的。”透过墙上的一个洞，他们看到了一个有趣的景象。猫在田里跳舞，吃玉米！现在亚瑟知道发生了什么。猫在晚上工作！之后，亚瑟对他的猫很好，给它们喂了很多玉米。

## 					The Big Race

A dog saw a group of animals across the road. He walked over to meet them.
“What are you doing?” he asked them.
“ I just sold them tickets to a race between the rabbit and the turtle,” the duck responded.
This news excited the dog. He felt fortunate that he happened to be there. “ I don’t have anything to do today,” the dog said. “ I want to buy a ticket, too.”
The dog sat down to observe the race. The race would be extreme. It would be many kilometers in length. The rabbit and the turtle stood next to each other. They waited for the race to start. The dog wondered why the turtle agreed to run against the rabbit. Being fast was not a characteristic of turtles. The rabbit was going to win easily.
Suddenly, the race began. The rabbit ran extremely quickly. The turtle walked slowly. After a minute, the rabbit looked back. He saw that the turtle was far behind him and was breathing quickly because he was so tired. The rabbit smiled and slowed to a walk.
A minute later, the rabbit said, “ I’m winning, so I’ll take a rest.” He sat and began to consume some grass. Then, he let his eyes close. He wasn’t the winner yet. But there was no risk of him losing the race. He went to sleep.
Hours later, a loud sound woke him. All of the animals were yelling and looking at the field. He felt fear for the first time. The turtle was almost at the finish line. Now, the rabbit realized his mistake. But the race was over. He gave the turtle an opportunity to win, and the turtle took it. The duck handed the turtle his prize. It was the happiest day of the turtle’s life.
The dog was happy for the turtle. “ He isn’t fast,” the dog thought. “ But he tried his best and did something great.”

大型比赛
一条狗看见马路对面有一群动物。他走过去迎接他们。
“你在干什么？”他问他们。
“我刚把兔子和乌龟赛跑的票卖给他们，”鸭子回答说。
这消息使狗很兴奋。他碰巧在那儿，感到很幸运。“我今天没什么事可做，”狗说。“我也想买票。”
狗坐下来观察比赛。比赛将是极端的。它的长度会有很多公里。兔子和乌龟站在一起。他们等待比赛开始。狗想知道为什么乌龟同意和兔子赛跑。快速不是海龟的特征。那只兔子很容易就赢了。
突然，比赛开始了。兔子跑得非常快。乌龟走得很慢。过了一会儿，兔子回头看了看。他看到乌龟远远地在他身后，因为他太累了，所以呼吸很快。兔子笑了笑，放慢脚步走了起来。
一分钟后，兔子说：“我赢了，我休息一下。”他坐下来开始吃草。然后，他闭上眼睛。他还没赢。但他没有输掉比赛的危险。他睡着了。
几个小时后，一声巨响吵醒了他。所有的动物都在大叫，看着田野。他第一次感到害怕。海龟快到终点了。现在，兔子意识到了他的错误。但比赛结束了。他给了乌龟一个获胜的机会，乌龟抓住了机会。鸭子把奖品递给乌龟。那是海龟一生中最快乐的一天。
狗为乌龟高兴。“他不快，”狗想。“但他尽了最大努力，做了一件了不起的事。”

## 				Adams County’s Gold

Adams Academy was a good school. Boys lived there and took classes. Tom worked hard all week. On a spring Saturday, he wanted to do something fun!
He asked his friend Jeff to go to the movie theater. “ Sorry,” Jeff answered. “ I’m going to a concert.”
So Tom asked Joe to go to the movies. But Joe’s soccer team had a game.
Next, Tom went down the hall to Brad’s room. Brad was reading a very large old book. “ Hi, Brad,” Tom said. “Are you reading a dictionary? It looks ancient.”
“ No. This is called The Wealth of Adams County. It’s about hidden gold in Adams County. It’s more than a century old. It was published in 1870 ! Look, it even has the original cover on it.”
Tom asked, “Where did you get it?”
“ It’s from my dad’s friend. He is a nice gentleman, an officer in the army,” answered Brad.
“The gold doesn’t really exist, does it?” Tom asked.
“ I don’t know, but maybe! There are clues to it in this book. Let’s find it!” Looking for gold sounded like fun.
The first clue was to find a flat tree underground. “ It must be in the forest,” Tom said.
Brad said, “The flat tree could be a board under the dirt. It could cover the gold.”
Tom and Brad dug in the dirt all morning. The process of looking for gold made them hungry. They were ready to stop for lunch. But then Brad hit something hard. It was a board!
Brad pounded on the board until it broke. There was a small hole under it. “ Look!” He held up a gold coin.
Tom saw a piece of paper in the hole. “ Brad, there’s more. It’s a map to the rest of the gold!”
Brad smiled. “ Let’s go!” And they hurried to find the wealth of Adams County.

亚当斯郡的黄金
亚当斯学院是一所好学校。男孩们住在那里上课。汤姆每周都努力工作。在一个春天的星期六，他想做一些有趣的事情！
他请他的朋友杰夫去电影院。“对不起，”杰夫回答。我要去听音乐会。
所以汤姆让乔去看电影。但是乔的足球队有一场比赛。
接着，汤姆走下大厅来到布拉德的房间。布拉德正在读一本很大的旧书。“嗨，布拉德，”汤姆说。你在看字典吗？它看起来很古老。”
“不，这叫亚当斯县的财富。是关于亚当斯郡的隐藏黄金。它有一个多世纪的历史了。1978年出版的！看，它甚至还有原始封面。”
汤姆问：“你从哪儿弄来的？“。”
是我爸爸的朋友寄来的。他是一位好绅士，一位军官，”布拉德回答。
“黄金并不真的存在，是吗？”汤姆问。
我不知道，但也许！这本书中有一些线索。让我们找到它！寻找黄金听起来很有趣。
第一条线索是在地下发现一棵扁树。“一定是在森林里，”汤姆说。
布拉德说：“这棵扁树可能是泥土下面的一块木板。它可以覆盖黄金。”
汤姆和布拉德挖了一上午的土。寻找黄金的过程使他们感到饥饿。他们准备停下来吃午饭。但后来布拉德打得很重。那是一块木板！
布拉德猛击木板，直到它碎了。下面有一个小洞。看！他举起一枚金币。
汤姆在洞里看到一张纸。“布拉德，还有更多。这是一张剩余黄金的地图！“。”
布拉德笑了。走吧！他们急忙去寻找亚当斯郡的财富。

## 				The Race for Water

There was a town next to a river. The people there had a lot of water. But theywasted it. That made the Sky angry. It said, “ If you waste water, I will take it away from you.” But the people didn’t listen.
When the season changed from spring to summer, the clouds disappeared. The bright sun was hot and made the river dry. There was no water available. People asked, “When will the rain fall?”
The Sky’s response was, “You don’t appreciate water. You waste it, and now I will never make rain again.”
A boy determined that this wasn’t fair. He thought of a solution. He asked the Sky to race him. He said, “ If I get to the top of that hill before your rain can form puddles, you must fill our river.”
The Sky laughed. “ Little boy, I am the Sky. I am above everything else. You cannot beat me.” But the boy knew he would win.
When the race began, the boy ran forward. The Sky started raining on the hill. But puddles did not form there. When it rained on the hill, the water went down.
The Sky kept raining. The water flowed down into the river. When the boy reached the top of the hill, the river was full. The people began to celebrate. It was the highest level the river had ever been at before.
The Sky was angry. “A boy can’t beat me! I won’t fill your river,” it said.
Now the boy laughed. “ It doesn’t matter whether you want to fill it or not,” he said. “You already did.” The Sky looked at the full river.
“You tricked me,” it said. It asked the people, “ Do you appreciate water now?”
“Yes,” they said. “We won’t waste it.”
That is how a lone boy saved his town and won the race for water.

水的竞赛
河边有个小镇。那里的人有很多水。但他们已经把它烧掉了。这让天空愤怒。它说，“如果你浪费水，我会把它从你身边带走。”但是人们不听。
当季节从春天变为夏天时，云消失了。明亮的太阳很热，使河水干涸。没有水可用。人们问：“什么时候下雨？“。”
天空的反应是，“你不喜欢水。你浪费了，现在我再也不会下雨了。”
一个男孩认为这不公平。他想出了一个解决办法。他请求天空与他赛跑。他说：“如果我在你的雨水形成水坑之前到达山顶，你就必须填满我们的河。”
天空笑了。“小男孩，我是天空。我高于一切。“你不能打我。”但男孩知道他会赢。
比赛开始时，男孩向前跑。天空开始在山上下雨。但那里并没有形成水坑。山上下雨时，水就流了下来。
天空一直在下雨。水流入河里。当男孩到达山顶时，河水已满。人们开始庆祝。这是这条河以前的最高水位。
天空很生气。“男孩打不过我！“我不会填满你的河，”它说。
现在男孩笑了。他说：“你想不想填满它并不重要。“你已经做到了。”天空看着满满的河水。
“你骗了我，”它说。它问人们：“你现在喜欢水吗？“。”
“是的，”他们说。“我们不会浪费的。”
这就是为什么一个孤独的男孩拯救了他的城市，赢得了水的竞赛。

## 				The Little Red Chicken

A little red chicken had a store in a small town. She sold many different items to people in the town. The people loved her products.
One day, a cat came to her property. He saw the sign that indicated where the chicken’s store was located. He wanted to purchase bread, but the chicken’s store was almost empty. She had only a bag of wheat.*
“You can use the wheat to make bread,” the chicken said.
“ No, I don’t want to work,” the cat said. “ I just want to buy bread.” The cat became angry and left the store.
Later, the little red chicken saw the cat in a crowd.
“ I will help you make the bread,” she said.
But the cat treated her badly. He did not even communicate with her.
He did not want to do any work.
So the chicken decided to make the bread. She selected the exact amount of wheat to make fresh bread. She used a stone to pound the wheat to get it ready. Soon, her bread was ready.
The cat came and saw the bread on a dish.
“ Give me some of your bread,” he said.
“ No,” said the little red chicken. “You did not help me make the bread. So you shall not have any to eat.”
The cat argued with the chicken. He tried to offer a price for it.
But the little red chicken did not want to sell her bread.
“ Don’t depend on others to do work for you,” said the little red chicken.
“Then how will I get bread?” the cat asked.
“ I recommend doing some work,” said the little red chicken. “ Use a tool to plant your own wheat. When it grows big, you can gather it and make your own bread. You need to learn to do work for what you want.”

小红鸡
一只小红鸡在一个小镇上开了一家商店。她把许多不同的东西卖给镇上的人。人们喜欢她的产品。
一天，一只猫来到她的房子。他看到了标明鸡肉店所在地的牌子。他想买面包，但鸡肉店几乎空荡荡的。她只有一袋小麦。
“你可以用小麦做面包，”鸡说。
“不，我不想工作，”猫说。“我只想买面包。”猫生气了，离开了商店。
后来，小红鸡在人群中看见了猫。
“我来帮你做面包，”她说。
但是猫对她很不好。他甚至没有和她交流。
他不想做任何工作。
所以鸡决定做面包。她挑选了确切数量的小麦做新鲜面包。她用一块石头把小麦捣好。很快，她的面包就做好了。
猫来了，看见盘子上的面包。
“给我一些面包，”他说。
“不，”小红鸡说。“你没有帮我做面包。所以你不应该吃任何东西。”
猫和鸡吵架了。他想报个价。
但是小红鸡不想卖她的面包。
“别指望别人为你工作，”小红鸡说。
“那我怎么才能得到面包呢？”猫问。
“我建议你做点工作，”小红鸡说。“用工具自己种小麦。当它长大了，你可以把它收集起来自己做面包。你需要学会做你想做的事。”

Shipwrecked
.Simon Yates was a lawyer. He helped many people. However, he was not a nice man. His policy was to help only rich people. He didn’t bother about social injustice. He made a lot of money, but many people didn’t like him. Even people on his staff didn’t like him. They wanted bad things to happen to him. In fact, they were glad when he got into trouble.
Simon had a very bad day. He did many things wrong and lost his job. Soon, he didn’t have any money. His wife, Mrs. Yates, began to have doubts about him. Simon wanted to start a new life. He planned to leave the country.
He mentioned his plan to the captain of a ship. The captain was exploring the world. The captain felt bad for Simon and said, “ I will take you to foreign countries.” They left the next day.
Near the conclusion of their international trip, the weather turned bad. A wave pushed Simon off the boat. But he was alive. He swam toward an island. After a longtime he got there.
At first he was upset. He was lost and alone. “ I’ll never go home again,” he thought. He had a lot of problems, but he survived. He built a house in a tree. He lived on a diet offish. He made tools from wood and bones. He made a cup to drink rainwater.
Slowly he learned to be happy on the island. He swam every day. He had trouble sometimes, but he always found a way to fix the problem. Life was simple. He liked it.
Finally, people on a ship saw Simon on the island. They wanted to take him home. But Simon was happy. He gave them a long speech about life. He said he wanted to stay. He liked his new, simple life more than his old life.

他向船长提了他的计划。船长在探索世界。船长为西蒙感到难过，说：“我带你去外国。”他们第二天就离开了。
他们的国际旅行快结束时，天气就变坏了。海浪把西蒙推下船。但他还活着。他向一个岛游去。很长一段时间后他到了那里。
一开始他很沮丧。他迷路了，独自一人。“我再也不会回家了，”他想。他有很多问题，但他活了下来。他在树上盖了一座房子。他靠吃鱼为生。他用木头和骨头做工具。他做了一个杯子来喝雨水。
他慢慢地学会了在岛上快乐。他每天都游泳。他有时会遇到麻烦，但他总能找到解决问题的办法。生活很简单。他喜欢。
最后，船上的人看到西蒙在岛上。他们想带他回家。但西蒙很高兴。他给他们作了一个关于生活的长篇演说。他说他想留下来。他喜欢新的，简单的生活胜过旧的生活。

## 				The Seven Cities of Gold

Many years ago, a Spanish officer named Coronado heard the story of sevengreat cities. “The walls of these cities are made of gold,” his friends told him. “The people eat meat from golden plates and dress in nice clothes,” they said. They called these cities the Seven Cities of Gold. Were the cities real? Coronado never considered asking his friends.
Coronado thought to himself, “The things in these cities must be worth a lot of money.” So he went to find the Seven Cities of Gold. He took along three hundred men, many horses, and extra food. They headed west. Coronado wanted to achieve his goal very badly.
Coronado and his men rode for many days. Then they saw some cities. “We found the Seven Cities of Gold!” his men yelled, but Coronado wasn’t happy. He had a different opinion. “These can’t be the Seven Cities of Gold,” he said. “ Look, they’re made of dirt!”
Coronado was right. The cities weren’t bright and golden. They were dirty and brown. The people didn’t eat meat from golden plates. They ate vegetables from regular bowls. They wore the most basic clothes.
Coronado regarded the cities as ugly places. “What happened to the cities of gold?” he thought. “ Did someone destroy them? Was there a war? Did someone already come and take the gold?”
That night, the people of the cities entertained Coronado and his men and served them food. They advised Coronado to go home. “There is
no gold here,” they told him. Coronado was angry Did his friends lie to him?
He left the next morning. He looked back at the cities one more time. The sun reflected light on the dirt houses. Coronado thought he saw a bit of gold. Were his friends right after all? “ No,” he told himself. “ It’s just the sun.” Then he turned away and went home.

黄金七城
许多年前，一位名叫科罗纳多的西班牙军官听说了塞文格拉特城市的故事。他的朋友们告诉他：“这些城市的城墙都是金子做的。”他们说：“人们吃金盘子里的肉，穿着漂亮的衣服。”他们称这七座城为金城。城市是真的吗？科罗纳多从未考虑过问他的朋友。
科罗纳多心里想：“这些城市里的东西一定值很多钱。”于是他去寻找那七座黄金城市。他带了三百人、许多马和额外的食物。他们往西走。科罗纳多非常渴望实现他的目标。
科罗纳多和他的部下骑了很多天。然后他们看到了一些城市。“我们找到了黄金七城！”他的手下喊道，但科罗纳多并不高兴。他有不同的看法。他说：“这不可能是黄金的七城。”“看，它们是用泥土做的！“。”
科罗纳多是对的。城市并不明亮，也不是金色的。它们又脏又棕色。人们不吃金盘子里的肉。他们吃普通碗里的蔬菜。他们穿着最基本的衣服。
科罗纳多认为这些城市是丑陋的地方。“黄金之城怎么了？”他想。“有人摧毁了他们吗？有战争吗？有人已经来拿金子了吗？“。”
当晚，城里的人款待科罗纳多和他的部下，并为他们提供食物。他们建议科罗纳多回家。“有
“这里没有金子，”他们告诉他。科罗纳多很生气他的朋友们对他撒谎了吗？
第二天早上他就走了。他又一次回望那些城市。太阳把光线反射到土房子上。科罗纳多以为他看到了一点金子。他的朋友到底对不对？“不，”他自言自语道。“只是太阳。”然后他转身回家。

## 						Katy

I first met 8-year-old Katy on a rainy afternoon. I was a nurse at a hospital. The clerk at the desk told me about Katy. She was there because she felt a lot of pain. The doctors located a problem at the base of her brain. I knew she was special, even before she got better. I’ll always remember Katy as a hero.
When I entered Katy’s room, she was not in her bed. She was in a chair next to Tommy, a little boy. Though Katy did not feel well, she was playing with Tommy and his toys. It took a lot of effort for her just to sit in the chair. But she played with Tommy because it made him happy.
Katy was always smiling and never appeared to be in pain. She refused to just lie in bed. One day I found her painting a picture. Later, she gave it to one of the older patients. Another day she went outside to get flowers for another sick little
girl. Katy made everyone smile.
The doctors hurried to fix the problem in Katy’s brain. The operation was successful! The doctors informed the hospital staff of the good news. Katy was fine. She soon felt excellent. She got better and was able to leave the hospital a month later.
I have had a long career as a nurse. I have met many patients. However, I have never met another girl like Katy. Even after she got well, she still came to the hospital. She played various games with the young patients. She read many books to the older patients. Katy’s kind heart helped her get better so quickly. She is a hero to me and everyone else at the hospital.

凯蒂
我第一次见到8岁的凯蒂是在一个下雨的下午。我是一家医院的护士。服务台的职员告诉我凯蒂的事。她在那里是因为她感到很痛。医生在她的大脑底部发现了一个问题。我知道她很特别，甚至在她好转之前。我永远记得凯蒂是个英雄。
当我进入凯蒂的房间时，她不在床上。她坐在汤米旁边的椅子上，一个小男孩。虽然凯蒂觉得不舒服，但她在和汤米和他的玩具玩。她只是坐在椅子上花了很多功夫。但她和汤米玩是因为这让他开心。
凯蒂总是微笑着，似乎从来没有痛苦过。她不肯只是躺在床上。一天我发现她在画一幅画。后来，她把它给了一个年长的病人。又有一天，她出去给另一个生病的小孩买花
女孩。凯蒂让每个人都笑了。
医生们急忙去解决凯蒂脑子里的问题。手术成功了！医生把这个好消息通知了医院的工作人员。凯蒂很好。她很快就感觉棒极了。她好转了，一个月后就可以出院了。
我做护士的职业生涯很长。我见过很多病人。然而，我从未见过像凯蒂这样的女孩。即使她病好了，她还是来了医院。她和年轻病人玩各种各样的游戏。她给老年病人读了许多书。凯蒂善良的心帮助她很快康复。她是我和医院其他人心目中的英雄。

## 					A Better Reward

Jenny delivered food for a restaurant. She read the newspaper and said, “ Uh oh.” There was a story about a thief. He stole food, and no one had seen him. Even the police couldn’t catch him. Jenny was a little scared. She worked close to that area.
The newspaper included a message from the police: “ If anything strange occurs, call us. If you help us catch the thief, you’ll earn a reward.”
Jenny talked to Jim. He managed the restaurant. “ Do you know about the thief?”
“Yes,” he said. “ But he steals more than one person can eat. And why haven’t the police stopped him yet? It’s a mystery. If you see him, contact the police. Don’t run after him.”
Jenny drove to a customer’s house. She left her car and opened the gate to the house. But then she heard a noise by her car. She yelled, “Thief!” She wasn’t scared. She wanted the reward! She did the opposite of what Jim told herto do.
“ Hey,” she yelled. “ Get back here!” She set the food on the ground and ran to her car.
But the thief had already left with the food. Jenny followed a noise around the corner. She was amazed. She saw a dog and some puppies. They were eating her food! They looked thin and scared. “The actual thief is just a dog. She’s feeding her puppies,” she said. “That’s why she steals so much food.”
Jenny felt bad. She tried to comfort the dogs with another plate of food. Then she took them back to the store. Everyone there took a puppy home. Jenny called the police. She told them there was no real thief.
Jenny didn’t do it to receive the reward anymore. She said, “ It was just a dog. But there’s no charge for catching this ‘thief,’”
she said. “ My new dog is a better reward.”

更好的奖励
珍妮给一家餐馆送饭。她看了报纸说：“哦哦。”有一个关于小偷的故事。他偷了食物，没人看见他。连警察都抓不到他。珍妮有点害怕。她在那附近工作。
报纸上有一条来自警方的消息：“如果有什么奇怪的事情发生，打电话给我们。如果你帮我们抓到小偷，你会得到奖赏的。”
珍妮和吉姆谈过了。他经营这家餐馆。“你知道小偷的事吗？“。”
“是的，”他说。“但他偷的东西不止一个人能吃。为什么警察还没阻止他？这是个谜。如果你看到他，请联系警察。别追他。”
珍妮开车去了一个顾客家。她离开汽车，打开了通往房子的大门。但后来她听到车旁有声音。她喊道：“小偷！“她并不害怕。她想要奖赏！她做的与吉姆告诉她的相反。
“嘿，”她喊道。“回来！她把食物放在地上，跑向她的车。
但小偷已经带着食物离开了。珍妮在拐角处跟着一声巨响。她很惊讶。她看见一条狗和一些小狗。他们在吃她的食物！他们看起来又瘦又害怕。“真正的小偷只是一条狗。她在喂小狗，”她说。“这就是她偷这么多食物的原因。”
珍妮感到很难过。她试图用另一盘食物来安慰狗。然后她把他们带回商店。那里的每个人都带了一只小狗回家。珍妮报了警。她告诉他们没有真正的小偷。
珍妮不再为了得到奖赏而这样做了。她说，“那只是一只狗。但抓这个‘贼’是不收费的。”
她说。“我的新狗是更好的奖励。”

## 					The Camp

Stacie wanted to stay at a nice hotel for vacation. But her parents sent her to a terrible camp instead. For breakfast, Stacie liked fresh juice and chocolate milk, but she got water at the camp. In the afternoon she wanted to write poems, but she had to swim. The camp was near an airport with loud planes. Spiderwebs hung over her bed. To her, the kids’ average behavior was very bad. No girl matched
her personality. She hated it.
One day, they had a class. Mental exercise sounded good to Stacie. But it was a course on water safety. They learned how to be safe passengers on a boat. Stacie didn’t ever plan to go on a boat.
The next day, they played a game. There were a red team and a blue team. Stacie was on the blue team. Each team had to try to remove the other team’s flag from a pole. They also had to use water guns. “ I’m not much of an athlete,” she said. But she still had to play.
Stacie took a water gun and looked for somewhere to hide. A boy said, “ Stacie, you advance to the middle. I will go right. Those two will go left.”
Stacie still didn’t want to play. She walked into the forest and saw a red team player coming. Stacie hid behind a tree and then jumped
out and shot the other player. “This is fun!” Stacie thought.
Several minutes after advancing further, Stacie saw the red flag. A red team member was watching over it. She shot him with her water gun. Then she lowered the flag and ran back to her team. “ I got it!” she yelled. The blue team won! Stacie was the hero.
For the rest of the week, Stacie had fun. She even made new friends.

史黛西拿起水枪，找个地方藏起来。一个男孩说：“斯泰西，你往中间走。我马上去。那两个人会向左走。”
斯泰西还是不想玩。她走进森林，看见一个红队队员来了。史黛西躲在一棵树后面，然后跳了起来。
把另一个球员射出去。“真有趣！”斯泰西想。
再往前走几分钟后，斯泰西看到了红旗。一个红队队员正在监视。她用水枪向他开枪。然后她降下旗子跑回了她的队伍。“我明白了！”她喊道。蓝队赢了！史黛西是英雄。
接下来的一周，斯泰西玩得很开心。她甚至交了新朋友。

## 				A Strong Friendship

Tim was the strongest man in the town. When he played sports, he always won. He performed and exercised in the public park. He did this to show everyone how strong he was. Most people liked him, but one man didn’t. His name was Jack.
Jack hated Tim. Jack was a movie critic and the smartest man in town. He could solve complex math problems. But no one cared. Jack wanted to be famous like Tim.
One day, there was an unusual event. A big storm came suddenly. Snow covered the town. No one could get out. They needed food. The people said, “This is a task for a strong man.” Tim was under pressure to save them. But Jack wanted to be the hero, so they both went. Tim said, “You can’t help because of your lack of strength.”
But Jack found some small passages under the snow. One of them led toward another town. That town had food. Because Tim was so big and strong, he almost couldn’t fit inside. They walked until there was a block of ice in their way. Jack said, “We can’t get past it. But if you strike it, it might break.” Tim knew that was probable.
He broke it. When there were more ice blocks, Tim broke them. That made him tired. He couldn’t walk anymore. Jack said, “ Let’s unite and
support each other. I’ll get the food alone. You rest here.”
Jack came back with food. Tim couldn’t remember which passage led home. He needed Jack to be his guide. The men became friends by working together.
In town, people saw Jack with the food and cheered. They called Jack a hero. But Jack didn’t care. He was thinking of something else. He said to Tim, “ I thought I was smart, but I learned a new term today: friendship.”

牢固的友谊
蒂姆是镇上最强壮的人。他运动时总是赢。他在公园里表演和锻炼。他这样做是为了让大家知道他有多坚强。大多数人都喜欢他，但有一个人不喜欢。他叫杰克。
杰克恨蒂姆。杰克是个影评家，也是城里最聪明的人。他能解决复杂的数学问题。但没人在意。杰克想像蒂姆一样出名。
有一天，发生了一件不寻常的事。突然来了一场大风暴。雪覆盖了整个城镇。没人能出去。他们需要食物。人们说：“这是一个强壮的人的任务。”提姆在压力下救了他们。但是杰克想成为英雄，所以他们都去了。蒂姆说：“你不能帮助，因为你缺乏力量。”
但是杰克在雪下找到了一些小通道。其中一个朝另一个城镇走去。那个城镇有食物。因为蒂姆又大又壮，他几乎无法适应。他们一直走到路上有一块冰。杰克说：“我们过不去。但如果你击中它，它可能会折断。
他把它弄坏了。当有更多的冰块时，蒂姆打破了它们。这让他很累。他再也不能走路了。杰克说：“让我们团结起来
互相支持。我一个人去拿食物。你在这里休息。”
杰克带着食物回来了。蒂姆不记得是哪条路通向家。他需要杰克做他的向导。这些人通过一起工作成了朋友。
在城里，人们看到杰克拿着食物欢呼。他们称杰克为英雄。但杰克不在乎。他在想别的事。他对蒂姆说：“我以为我很聪明，但今天我学会了一个新名词：友谊。”

## 					Joe’s Pond

Joe made the world a better place. He got the idea to do that at school. He watched a video there. It was about a factory. This factory produced a lot of trash and put it in a river. The trash and water were a bad mix. People populated the area by the river and drank its water. This made them sick. Many of them needed medicine and made regular visits to doctors.
But the video wasn’t all bad news. It showed ways to pick up trash and why it’s important to do this. It said people can make a difference to their environment. The video’s important features made Joe associate trash with hurting people.
One day Joe walked through a park. He recognized some of the problems from the video. One instance of these problems was the trash in the pond. It was full of plastic cups. There was too much trash. Joe didn’t want it to hurt anyone.
He told his grandfather about the park. His grandfather said, “You know, it’s a tradition in our family to help people. That’s why we give food to poor people. Maybe you can help people by cleaning the park.”
Cleaning the park would involve hard work. Joe decided to organize a group to help him. He chose a wide area of the park. It had the most trash. He asked his family and friends to come. On Saturday, he gave everyone a sharp stick. They wondered why. He said, “You use the stick’s tip to pick up trash. This makes it easier.” They worked for six weeks. Different people helped each time, but Joe was always there.
In that period of time, Joe saw a range of results. There was no trash in the water. People could swim in it. Joe knew that was a good sign. He was happy because he helped his environment.

乔的池塘
乔使世界变得更美好。他在学校有这个想法。他在那里看了一段录像。是关于一家工厂的。这家工厂生产了许多垃圾，并把它们放在河里。垃圾和水混合得不好。人们在河边居住，喝着河水。这让他们恶心。他们中的许多人需要药物并定期去看医生。
但视频并不全是坏消息。它展示了捡垃圾的方法以及为什么这么做很重要。它说人们可以改变他们的环境。这段视频的重要特点使乔把垃圾与伤害他人联系起来。
一天，乔走过一个公园。他从录像中认出了一些问题。这些问题的一个例子是池塘里的垃圾。里面装满了塑料杯。垃圾太多了。乔不想伤害任何人。
他把公园的事告诉了他的祖父。他的祖父说：“你知道，帮助别人是我们家的传统。这就是为什么我们给穷人食物。也许你可以帮人们打扫公园。”
打扫公园需要艰苦的工作。乔决定组织一个小组来帮助他。他选择了公园的一大片区域。垃圾最多。他请他的家人和朋友来。星期六，他给了每个人一根锋利的棍子。他们想知道为什么。他说，“你用棍子的尖端捡垃圾。这就容易多了。”他们工作了六个星期。每次都有不同的人帮忙，但乔总是在那里。
在那段时间里，乔看到了一系列的结果。水里没有垃圾。人们可以在里面游泳。乔知道这是个好兆头。他很高兴，因为他帮助了他的环境。

## 				Archie and His Donkey

Old Archie needed some money. He decided to sell his donkey. So he and his son Tom went to town. It was situated many miles away.
Soon, they met a woman. “Where are you going?” she asked.
“To town,” said Archie.
“Any smart person would ride the donkey,” she said.
“What are you implying?” Archie asked. “ I’m very smart!” Archie wanted to look smart. So he climbed onto the donkey. Then they continued in the direction of the town.
Further along the road, they met a farmer.
“ Hello,” said Archie. “We want to sell this donkey. Do you want to buy it?”
“ I don’t need a donkey,” said the farmer. “ But if you want my advice, don’t ride it. The donkey needs to be in good physical condition.”
“ Good idea,” said Archie. “Tom, I want you to ride it. You’re lighter.”
“ Neither you nor your son should ride it. It looks very tired. You should carry the donkey.” suggested the farmer.
“You’re right,” said Archie. “Come on, Tom! We’ll carry it for the final few miles!”
The donkey was very heavy, and they couldn’t maintain a good speed. They didn’t arrive until late in the evening. At last, they walked into the town. But there they attracted the attention of some teenage boys. They laughed at Tom and Archie. They started to throw stones at them. The donkey reacted by kicking. Tom and Archie dropped the donkey. It fell on the ground and then ran away. Archie lost his donkey. He went home with no money.
What does this story teach us? We cannot please everyone in our society. Don’t take everyone’s advice, but set your own standards. Prove to everyone that you can make decisions by yourself.Otherwise,you may end up with nothing at all.

阿奇和他的驴子
老阿奇需要一些钱。他决定卖掉他的驴。所以他和他的儿子汤姆进城去了。它坐落在许多英里之外。
很快，他们遇到了一个女人。“你要去哪里？”她问。
“去城里，”阿奇说。
“任何聪明人都会骑驴，”她说。
“你在暗示什么？“阿奇问。“我很聪明！“阿奇想看起来很聪明。于是他爬上驴子。然后他们继续朝城镇的方向走去。
再往前走，他们遇到一个农民。
“你好，”阿奇说。“我们想卖掉这头驴。你想买吗？“。”
“我不需要驴，”农夫说。“但是如果你想听我的建议，就不要骑它。驴子需要身体状况良好。”
“好主意，”阿奇说。“汤姆，我要你骑它。你更轻了。”
“你和你儿子都不应该骑它。看起来很累。“你应该背着驴。”农夫建议道。
“你说得对，”阿奇说。“来吧，汤姆！我们会把它带到最后几英里！“。”
驴子很重，他们不能保持很快的速度。他们直到深夜才到达。最后，他们走进了镇上。但在那里他们吸引了一些十几岁男孩的注意。他们嘲笑汤姆和阿奇。他们开始向他们扔石头。驴子的反应是踢。汤姆和阿奇把驴扔了。它掉在地上然后跑掉了。阿奇的驴子丢了。他没带钱回家。
这个故事教我们什么？我们不能取悦社会上的每一个人。不要接受每个人的建议，要树立自己的标准。向每个人证明你可以自己做决定。否则，你可能会一无所获。

## 			The Spider and the Bird

There was once a very big spider. If a bug got into his web, he would examine it. However, he didn’t eat the bug right away. He asked the bug a question first. It was always quite a difficult puzzle. If the bug’s answer was correct, he let it go. If not, he ate it.
One day, a small bird on a journey flew into the spider’s web. The spider couldn’t imagine eating a bird. It was so big! But his hunger was too great. He said to the bird, “ If you cannot give me a specific answer, I will eat you.”
The bird laughed. “ I could eat you!” But the bird was actually scared. She had used all her energy trying to get out of the web. And a spider’s bite can be very effective in killing animals.
“ Please don’t eat me,” the bird said. “ I would rather make a deal with you.”
“ OK,” the spider said. “ If your answer is right, I will let you go. If not, you must give me a gift. It must be something of great value.”
The bird said, “You can pick anything you want to eat. I will find it for you.” The spider agreed.
“Where can you take a trip to the coast, the desert, and the mountains at the same time?” the spider asked.
The bird asked, “ Does this place have earthquakes?” But the spider did not say anything. “ I can see those places when I fly. Is the ‘sky’ the right answer?”
“ False!” said the spider. “The answer is Hawaii! Now you must find some bugs for me.”
The spider climbed on the bird’s back. They flew and ate bugs together. They took a tour of the forest.Then the bird took the spider home. From that day on, they were friends. And they never tried to eat each other again.

蜘蛛和鸟
从前有一只很大的蜘蛛。如果一个虫子进入他的网络，他会检查它。然而，他并没有马上吃掉虫子。他先问了虫子一个问题。这总是一个相当难的谜题。如果虫子的回答是正确的，他就放了它。如果没有，他就吃了。
一天，一只正在旅行的小鸟飞进了蜘蛛网。蜘蛛无法想象吃鸟。太大了！但他太饿了。他对小鸟说：“如果你不能给我一个明确的答案，我就吃掉你。”
小鸟笑了。“我可以吃了你！“但那只鸟其实很害怕。她用尽了所有的精力试图摆脱网络。蜘蛛的咬伤可以非常有效地杀死动物。
“请不要吃我，”鸟说。“我宁愿和你做个交易。”
“好吧，”蜘蛛说。“如果你的回答是对的，我就放你走。如果没有，你必须给我一份礼物。一定是很有价值的东西。”
小鸟说：“你想吃什么就挑什么。“我会帮你找到的。”蜘蛛同意了。
“你在哪里可以同时去海边、沙漠和山区旅行呢？”蜘蛛问。
鸟儿问：“这个地方有地震吗？“但是蜘蛛什么也没说。“我飞的时候能看到那些地方。“天空”是正确的答案吗？“。”
“假的！蜘蛛说。“答案是夏威夷！现在你必须给我找些虫子。”
蜘蛛爬上了鸟的背。他们一起飞行和吃虫子。他们参观了森林，然后鸟把蜘蛛带回家。从那天起，他们就是朋友。他们再也不想吃对方了。

## 					The Party

Cody’s family moved to a new house. His dad got a new job as a professor. Cody liked his new town, but he missed his grandparents. For his birthday, Cody wanted to have a party. His dad said, “Yes, we could even have a band play!”
On the day of the party, Cody woke up and rushed to get ready. He started to check his list of things to do. He was so excited! But then he noticed something terrible. There was snow on the ground and lots of it! “ Dad!” he yelled. “ How can the band play their instruments outside?”
Dad said, “We’ll move the stage inside.” It barely fit within the garage because there were some boxes and garbage there. But when they finished, they got a call from the band. They did not want to come in the snow storm.
Dad said, “ Let’s get someone to perform magic.” But no one would come because of the snow.
Finally, Dad said, “ Cody, there’s too much snow. We need to cancel the party.”
“Yes, sir,” Cody said sadly. “ It’s going to be a boring birthday,” he predicted. Cody wanted to share his birthday with someone. He wanted to be at his old home. He wanted to see his grandparents.
But then something got his attention. He noticed a car in the driveway. His grandparents owned a car like that!
Cody was right. His grandparents came for his birthday! “ Happy birthday, Cody! We’re sorry we are late. But there was so much snow. It made us go off schedule. We tried to leave a message to tell you.”
Cody told them what happened. “ I’m sorry,” said Grandpa.
“ I was sad,” Cody said. “ ButI’m not anymore. I’m so happy tosee you.” Dad brought out Cody’sbirthday treat. It was his favoritetype, a sundae with whipped cream on top. Then Cody told his grandparents about the new town. It was his best birthday ever.

## 			How the World Got Light

The president of Darkland was a pig—a very bad pig. He was a pig of major importance. He was rich, and he had a lot of strength. But he was mean to all the animals in Darkland. He kept all of the world’s light in a bag. He preferred to keep the world cool and dark. He wanted to stop the progress of the city. The animals couldn’t work in the dark. He didn’t have any respect for them. “ Light is too good
for them,” he said. “ Only I should have light.”
But the animals needed light. So they decided to hold a competition. They wanted to find the smartest animal in Darkland. That animal had to steal light from the president. They advertised the competition everywhere. All the animals came.
The animals all showed off their skills. The audience watched and then voted for the animal with the most knowledge. The winner was a tall bird named Raven. They assigned him the job of getting light.
The next morning, Raven ate breakfast and then left his home. “ How will I gain light from the president?” thought Raven. He needed to trick the president somehow. Then, Raven had an idea. Raven could make his voice sound like anything!
Raven walked up to the president’s door. He made the sound of a crying baby. He cried very loudly. Soon, the president opened the door.
“ Be quiet!” the president yelled. Right then, Raven quickly made his move. He flew by the pig and found the soft bag. He took it outside. The sun was inside the bag!
Raven flew high and put the sun in the sky. The president was very mad. Raven tricked him!But the other animals were very happy. At last, they had light—all because of Raven's smart thinking.

世界如何变得光明
奥克兰总统是头猪，一头非常坏的猪。他是一头非常重要的猪。他很有钱，而且很有力气。但他对所有的动物都很刻薄。他把世界上所有的光都藏在一个袋子里。他宁愿让世界保持凉爽和黑暗。他想阻止这座城市的发展。动物在黑暗中不能工作。他一点也不尊重他们。“光线太好了
为了他们，”他说。“只有我才应该有光。”
但是动物需要光。所以他们决定举行一场比赛。他们想在奥克兰找到最聪明的动物。那只动物不得不向总统偷光。他们到处宣传竞争对手。所有的动物都来了。
动物们都展示了他们的技能。观众们观看了比赛，然后投票选出了知识最渊博的动物。获胜者是一只名叫乌鸦的高鸟。他们给他分配了采光的工作。
第二天早上，乌鸦吃了早饭，然后离开了家。“我怎样才能从总统那里得到光明？乌鸦想。他需要以某种方式欺骗总统。然后，乌鸦有了一个主意。乌鸦能发出任何声音！
乌鸦走向总统的门。他发出婴儿啼哭的声音。他哭得很大声。很快，总统打开了门。
“安静点！”总统喊道。就在这时，乌鸦迅速采取了行动。他飞过猪的身边，发现了那个软袋子。他把它带到外面。太阳在包里！
乌鸦飞得很高，把太阳放在空中。总统非常生气。乌鸦骗了他！但其他动物都很高兴。最后，因为乌鸦聪明的思维，他们终于有了光明。

## 					Cats and Secrets

In English, there is a common idiom “ let the cat out of the bag.” It means to tell a secret. But where did this idiom start?
It came from a section of England. Long ago, people there went from town to town to sell things like vegetables, clothes, and pigs. They had strong beliefs about honesty. They didn’t like lying. One day, a man went to the section’s center to sell things.
“ I have a baby pig for sale! It won’t cost much,” he said. He held the animal above his head. His style was different from honest people’s style. He was a master of tricking people and lying.
A woman named Beth scanned his pig. He offered her the pig for one gold coin. That was a very small amount. Beth gave him the coin. He put it in his pocket. He walked ahead of Beth to get the pig.
He gave her a closed bag and said, “ Here’s your pig.” He then left very quickly.
Beth looked at the bag’s surface. It was moving. She opened it to let the pig out. A cat was inside! “ He tricked me! That isn’t proper,” she said.
Later, the man returned to trick more people. Beth saw him and the memory of the cat came back. She told her friends. They stopped him. But no one knew what to do next.
Someone said, “We need an independent and fair person to decide that.” They went to the judge. Beth told him about the cat in the bag.
The judge asked, “ Is there evidence? Can you demonstrate how he did it?”
“ Look in his bag,” said Beth. She opened it and let a cat out of the bag. They learned the man’s secret, and he went to jail.
That’s how the idiom “ let the cat out of the bag” came to mean to tell a secret.

猫与秘密
在英语中，有一个很常见的成语“让猫从袋子里出来”。意思是告诉别人一个秘密。但是这个成语是从哪里开始的呢？
它来自英国的一个地区。很久以前，那里的人从一个城镇到另一个城镇去卖蔬菜、衣服和猪。他们对诚实有坚定的信念。他们不喜欢撒谎。一天，一个男人去部门的中心卖东西。
“我有一头小猪要卖！不会花很多钱。”他把动物举过头顶。他的作风不同于老实人的作风。他是一个骗人和撒谎的高手。
一个叫贝丝的女人扫描了他的猪。他把猪给她换了一枚金币。那是一个很小的数目。贝丝把硬币给了他。他把它放在口袋里。他走在贝丝前面去抓猪。
他给了她一个密封的袋子，说：“这是你的猪。”然后他很快离开了。
贝丝看着包的表面。它在移动。她打开它让猪出来。一只猫在里面！“他骗了我！这不合适，”她说。
后来，这个人又回来欺骗更多的人。贝丝看见他，那只猫的记忆又回来了。她告诉她的朋友们。他们阻止了他。但没人知道下一步该怎么办。
有人说，“我们需要一个独立公正的人来决定这个问题。”他们去找法官。贝丝告诉他包里的猫。
法官问：“有证据吗？你能示范一下他是怎么做到的吗？“。”
“看看他的包，”贝丝说。她打开它，从包里放了一只猫。他们知道了那个人的秘密，他进了监狱。
这就是“放猫出袋”这个成语的意思。
